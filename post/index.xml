&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, it&amp;rsquo;s been a bit more than a year since I took a flight to Montréal to
start a PhD on mathematical optimization &amp;amp; game theory for demand response
on smart grids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the rush of summer conferences, and my return to France
for a part of my PhD at INRIA Lille, it&amp;rsquo;s a good time to take a step back
and think of what&amp;rsquo;s been going on and what&amp;rsquo;s coming. I&amp;rsquo;ll also answer
some common questions I have in a more thoughtful way than I can in a
bar conversation. Maybe this can also help other PhD students seeing
we are not in the same boat, but they all still look pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-when-are-you-going-to-finish&#34;&gt;So, when are you going to finish?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know, when are you going to finish your job? It doesn&amp;rsquo;t look
like it&amp;rsquo;s been moving that much recently. Or when will this company
you&amp;rsquo;re building be &amp;ldquo;finished&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These questions are similar, really. A research subject is rarely isolated,
don&amp;rsquo;t see this as emptying a 4-year bowl of soup. It&amp;rsquo;s more like picking
berries: you grab one, then the next, which is close enough, oh and this one
is nice, but a bit further, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to stretch my arm a bit more to reach it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/phd-year/blueberries.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had some interesting discussions in Montréal about when and how to know
you should bring your PhD to a conclusion. And the answer should always be
that it depends what your objectives are, if you want to include this last
project in the PhD. So no, I don&amp;rsquo;t know when I will finish, because if every
step was predictable in terms of duration and success, it would not be a PhD or
even research, what I do know is that I don&amp;rsquo;t want to block interesting projects
or leave only half-explored research trails because &amp;ldquo;3 years is plenty&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;it-must-feel-weird-getting-back-to-university&#34;&gt;It must feel weird, getting back to university&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It does, but not how you imagine. I was previously at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2016-08-11-back-to-startup/&#34;&gt;a startup&lt;/a&gt; for a while.
What I was used to is a great autonomy in execution. What the
PhD is about is adding self-determination of the objectives,
expected results, and means. It does not mean I&amp;rsquo;m working alone
while I was in a team before, it means the degree of ownership
of successes and failures is much higher, try to picture the
three following sentences in a conversation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I was at a startup before, it failed and I moved on to XYZ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I started a PhD but didn&amp;rsquo;t get through, then moved on to XYZ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;I built a company, it failed, now I&amp;rsquo;m working on XYZ.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends on the relationship to failure the person has in front of
you, but for those I know, (1) is just an external cause, while (2)
and (3) are personal failures, that&amp;rsquo;s ownership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest conclusion I made roughly after 6 months in is that a
single-founder startup is one of the closest mental models to keep
during the PhD, which explains several things, like inability to
explain exactly what you do to your family and friends, imposter
syndrome or procrastination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-you-get-paid-enough-to-buy-noodles&#34;&gt;So you get paid enough to buy noodles?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m living quite well thanks, I can even afford fancying
my noodles, but let&amp;rsquo;s dig deeper on the matter of €/$/£.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: my PhD is in applied maths &amp;amp; computer science, I know
all majors are not financially comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/phd-year/noodles.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also know it&amp;rsquo;s considered rude to talk about money in some cultures,
including France, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not complaining; so yes, I&amp;rsquo;ll
be rude.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m in France, I&amp;rsquo;m paid slightly less than some engineers with the same
level of qualification. The difference is higher if I&amp;rsquo;m comparing to what
I would have had on Data Science, applied maths and software development
positions. The difference between what I would earn and the scholarship
is higher in Canada. Still, like I said, I can live without watching
my bank account towards the end of the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest danger of getting money monthly is thinking of it as a salary,
meaning you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of the PhD as a job, meaning you&amp;rsquo;re thinking of
yourself as an employee. On the paper, the money I get in France is a salary
from my research institute, but one should keep in mind this is only on paper,
the danger is to get the wrong mindset: &lt;strong&gt;think of yourself as a single person
carrying a project, not an employee&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often argue that they have a research director, which is their boss.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is the case, directors choose project proposals and people
to carry them out (the order of this choice varies). They choose to invest
time, effort and money from their structure into this person+project pair,
without dictating to the letter what the outcomes of the projects are.
Their retribution for this exchange is a partial ownership in the outcomes
of the project (publications, conferences, software).
Sounds familiar? Yes I&amp;rsquo;m looking at the Wikipedia
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;page on Venture Capital&lt;/a&gt;.
Let&amp;rsquo;s dig deeper: thesis directors invest this time, money and energy in
areas they are familiar with, they have worked in and/or have mentored other
people on. This sounds like the VC firms&amp;rsquo; investment theses.
Read &lt;a href=&#34;https://a16z.com/2016/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/the-birth-of-a-venture-capital-investment-thesis-afd2903ae12&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;two&lt;/a&gt;
articles to see a more proper definition and examples of investment theses
but I hope you&amp;rsquo;ll get my point: PhDs are not R&amp;amp;D employees and directors are
not &amp;ldquo;bosses&amp;rdquo;. If you have friends familiar with how startups work, this should
be fine to explain. If you&amp;rsquo;re talking to people who have been employees their
whole life in traditional structures, I have not yet found a clear and simple
way to explain the situation in a casual conversation, let me know if you have
something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-back-to-being-a-student-heh&#34;&gt;So, back to being a student heh?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image is much easier to correct. On the paper this is true,
a PhD has a student status, even when working close with/in
companies like in Germany, Denmark or France CIFRE theses.
Some people will ask this genuinely because they still picture their
undergraduate years and think you&amp;rsquo;re back to this.
So, it&amp;rsquo;s true, I&amp;rsquo;m taking courses, mostly because I find them
interesting and keeping learning things is a bit of a &lt;em&gt;raison d&amp;rsquo;être&lt;/em&gt;.
But I was also doing so while working, using online courses platform like
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fun-mooc.fr/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;France Université Numérique&lt;/a&gt;, going to meetups,
reading and writing blog posts. So the thing that changed is maybe the part
of my time dedicated to learning which got higher than when employed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now about the second category of people asking this question, yeah those one.
In general, the points discussed above are enough as an explanation,
but if the tone is really about trolling, which can happen, reverse the question:
&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yeah I&amp;rsquo;m a student, I&amp;rsquo;m learning stuff every day. Wait you&amp;rsquo;re not?
Exactly the stagnation I don&amp;rsquo;t want in my life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it mean? Maybe, but the point is not to &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; a conversation, it&amp;rsquo;s about
shutting down the perpetration of imposter syndrome, own the uniqueness of
your status, both the good and the bad bits. None should be made feel inferior
because they didn&amp;rsquo;t take the conventional, safe and socially accepted path of
the 9-17 workday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;re-thinking-my-values-priorities&#34;&gt;Re-thinking my values &amp;amp; priorities&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve written about values &lt;a href=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2016-10-7-company-values/&#34;&gt;two years ago&lt;/a&gt;
in the context of a company trying to define who they are.
This is a complex topic, about discovering and understanding what the
group prioritizes collectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the owner of your project and of your time and resources, it&amp;rsquo;s up to you to define
what is important. This begins with what is measured for success. Coming to academia
from another &lt;em&gt;milieu&lt;/em&gt;, I was not used to the process of publishing in peer-reviewed
journals. First position I&amp;rsquo;ll take and try to maintain: &lt;strong&gt;the measures of academic
success are broken, or at least imperfect&lt;/strong&gt; (reach out to future-me if I change my mind).
One example of this is research software.
&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Paraphrasing &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mgymrek?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@mgymrek&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your paper is cited outside of your field in one semi-related paragraph: *counts towards your career progression*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Your academic software package has 100 stars on GitHub: *counts for nothing*&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Something is wrong here 😐 &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/jsm2018?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#jsm2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Sean Kross (@seankross) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/seankross/status/1024059834654588929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;July 30, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Had my &amp;quot;software is part of the research process&amp;quot; argument with an academic who wanted to use software to generate results but didn&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;concentrate on it too much&amp;quot;. I should start counting how many times I go through this and throw a party when I get to a million.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Simon Hettrick (@sjh5000) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/sjh5000/status/1043112943372644353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 21, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

If you can, watch
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/walkingrandomly&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mike Croucher&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s excellent
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZSaAM8hhJ4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; at JuliaCon 2018 for more
depth on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequence of ignoring software as a valuable result of research is
pretty straight-forward: proprietary software all over.
It&amp;rsquo;s changing in scientific computing, statistics and other fields with
the rise of Julia, R, Python. My domain, mathematical optimization, is
still behind with dominant solvers (the software doing the actual work)
and lots of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_modeling_language&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Algebraic Modeling Languages&lt;/a&gt;
(the front-end to interact with the solver) being proprietary.
The last part is &lt;a href=&#34;https://numfocus.org/project/jump&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;changing&lt;/a&gt;,
the first one is still tough.
My point is that people behind software you&amp;rsquo;re
using everyday contribute way more to the success of your PhD than this
obscure paper you cite because the review committee asked you to.
If your university is giving thousands in commercial licenses and
millions in access to paper, maybe you should make them donate both time
and money to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/MjM2OA==&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tools&lt;/a&gt;
you&amp;rsquo;re using. Yes all of &lt;a href=&#34;https://donate.wikimedia.org/wiki/WMFJA1/en/US&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been involved in the Julia community, especially within the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/JuliaGraphs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JuliaGraphs&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/JuliaStats/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JuliaStats&lt;/a&gt; ecosystems, mostly because these
are subjects I understand (at least a bit) and/or used.
Key take-away:
&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be an expert programmer to help out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting issues you have and contributing to improve the documentation
is as valuable as writing code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-it-s-been-a-year&#34;&gt;So&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s been a year&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I&amp;rsquo;m still learning (understand making mistakes, getting stuck, etc),
one of the reasons I had to learn more is not coming from a background
in maths, nor from a research-oriented degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reach out any way you prefer, &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/matbesancon&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/#contact&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;. Of course some things I&amp;rsquo;ve written are related
to my situation, I&amp;rsquo;d be interested to know how it relates or not to yours.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building our own graph type in Julia</title>

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an adapted post on the talk we gave with &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fairbanksjp&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;James&lt;/a&gt;
at JuliaCon 2018 in London. You can see the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/graph_interfaces_juliacon18&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;original slides&lt;/a&gt;,
the video still requires a bit of post-processing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week &lt;a href=&#34;http://juliacon.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JuliaCon&lt;/a&gt; in London was a great and very condensed experience.
The two talks on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;LightGraphs.jl&lt;/a&gt;
received a lot of positive feedback and more than that, we saw
how people are using the library for a variety of use cases which is a great
signal for the work on the JuliaGraphs ecosystem
(see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/graph_interfaces_juliacon18/ecosystem.html#/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;lightning talk&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to re-build the same graph for people who prefer a post version to
my clumsy live explanations on a laptop not handling dual-screen well
(those who prefer the latter are invited to see the live-stream of the talk).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-abstractions&#34;&gt;Why abstractions?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LightGraphs library is built to contain as few elements as possible to get
anyone going with graphs. This includes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The interface a graph type has to comply with to be used&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essential algorithms implemented by any graph respecting that interface&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple, battery-included implementation based on adjacency lists&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is, if you design an abstraction which in fact has just one
implementation, you&amp;rsquo;re doing abstraction wrong. This talks was also a
reality-check for LightGraphs, are we as composable, extensible as we promised?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason for abstraction is also that &lt;strong&gt;minimalism has its price&lt;/strong&gt;.
The package was designed as the least amount of complexity required to get
graphs working. When people started to use it, obviously they needed more
features, some of which they could code themselves, some other required
extensions built within LightGraphs. By getting the core abstractions right,
you guarantee people will be able to use it and to build on top with minimal
friction, while keeping it simple to read and contribute to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;our-matrix-graph-type&#34;&gt;Our matrix graph type&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s recall that a graph is a collection of &lt;em&gt;nodes&lt;/em&gt; and a collection of
&lt;em&gt;edges&lt;/em&gt; between these nodes. To keep it simple, for a graph of $n$ edges,
we will consider they are numbered from 1 to n. An edge connects a node $i$
to a node $j$, therefore all the information of a graph can be kept as an
&lt;em&gt;adjacency matrix&lt;/em&gt; $M_{ij}$ of size $n \times n$:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$M_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1, &amp;amp; \mbox{if edge (i $\rightarrow$ j) exists} \\ 0 &amp;amp; \mbox{otherwise}\end{cases}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;rsquo;t know what the use cases for our type will be, and therefore,
we will parametrize the graph type over the matrix type:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;LightGraphs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;lg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;LightGraphs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;MT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The edges are simply mapping an entry (i,j) to a boolean (whether there is an
edge from i to j). Even though creating a graph type that can be directed
or undirected depending on the situation is possible, we are creating a type
that will be directed by default.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementing-the-core-interface&#34;&gt;Implementing the core interface&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now implement the core LightGraphs interface for this type, starting
with methods defined over the type itself, of the form &lt;code&gt;function(g::MyType)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not going to re-define each function here, their meaning can be found
by checking the help in a Julia REPL: &lt;code&gt;?LightGraphs.vertices&lt;/code&gt; or on the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://juliagraphs.github.io/LightGraphs.jl/stable/types.html#AbstractGraph-Type-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;documentation page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the last function &lt;code&gt;edges&lt;/code&gt;, for which the documentation specifies that we
need to return an &lt;strong&gt;iterator&lt;/strong&gt; over edges. We don&amp;rsquo;t need to collect the comprehension
in a Vector, returning a lazy generator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some operations have to be defined on both the graph and a node, of the form
&lt;code&gt;function(g::MyType, node)&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;lg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;has_vertex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;MatrixDiGraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;lg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;nv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Out &lt;code&gt;MatrixDiGraph&lt;/code&gt; type is pretty straight-forward to work with and all
required methods are easy to relate to the way information is stored in the
adjacency matrix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last step is implementing methods on both the graph and an edge of the
form &lt;code&gt;function(g::MatrixDiGraph,e)&lt;/code&gt;. The only one we need here is:
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;lg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;has_edge&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;MatrixDiGraph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;g&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;optional-mutability&#34;&gt;Optional mutability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mutating methods were removed from the core interace some time ago,
as they are not required to describe a graph-like behavior.
The general behavior for operations mutating a graph is to return whether
the operation succeded. They consist in adding or removing elements from
either the edges or nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;ranks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;lg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;pagerank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;twitter_graph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the broadcast check &lt;code&gt;.==1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;adjacency_matrix&lt;/code&gt; is specified to yield a
matrix of &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, so we use this to cast the entries to boolean values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took only the first 10 nodes of the graph, but feel free to do the same with
500, 1000 or more nodes, depending on what your machine can stand  🙈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;overloading-non-mandatory-functions&#34;&gt;Overloading non-mandatory functions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some methods are already implemented for free by implementing the core interface.
That does not mean it should be kept as-is in every case. Depending on your
graph type, some functions might have smarter implementations, let&amp;rsquo;s see one
example. What &lt;code&gt;MatrixDiGraph&lt;/code&gt; is already an &lt;code&gt;adjacency_matrix&lt;/code&gt;, so we know
there should be no computation required to return it (it&amp;rsquo;s almost a no-op).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;BenchmarkTools&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;@btime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;@btime&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;lg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;adjacency_matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;bigger_twitter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;that&amp;#39;s better.&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should yield roughly:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;13.077 ms (5222 allocations: 682.03 KiB)
why did that take so long?
82.077 μs (6 allocations: 201.77 KiB)
that&#39;s better.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can fall down to a no-op by storing the matrix entries as &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; directly,
but the type ends up being a bit heavier in memory, your type, your trade-off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve implemented a graph type suited to our need in a couple lines of Julia,
guided by the &lt;code&gt;LightGraphs&lt;/code&gt; interface specifying &lt;strong&gt;how&lt;/strong&gt; to think about our
graph instead of getting in the way of &lt;strong&gt;what&lt;/strong&gt; to store. A lighter version
of this post can be read as &lt;a href=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/graph_interfaces_juliacon18/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, ping me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/matbesancon&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for any
question or comment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bonus&#34;&gt;Bonus&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read this and want to try building your own graph type, here are two
implementations you can try out, put them out in a public repo and show them off
afterwards:
1. We created a type just for directed graphs, why bothering so much? You can create your own type which can be directed or not,
either by storing the information in the &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; or by parametrizing the type
and getting the compiler to do the work for you.
2. We store the entries as an &lt;code&gt;AbstractMatrix{Bool}&lt;/code&gt;, if your graph is dense
enough (how dense? No idea), it might be interesting to store entries as as
&lt;code&gt;BitArray&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The cutting stock problem: part 2, solving with column generation</title>

      <description>

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2018-05-23-colgen/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;,
we explored a well-known integer optimization situation
in manufacturing, the cutting stock problem. After some details on the
decisions, constraints and objectives, we implemented a naive model in JuMP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One key thing to notice is the explosion of number of variables and constraints
and the fact that relaxed solutions (without constraining variables to be
integers) are very far from actual feasible solutions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will now use an other way of formulating the problem, using a problem
decomposition and an associated solution method (column generation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;re-stating-the-cutting-stock-problem&#34;&gt;Re-stating the cutting stock problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember we used two decisions: $Y_i$ stating if the big roll $i$ is
used and $X_{ij}$ expressing the number of cuts $j$ made in the roll $i$.
To minimize the number of rolls, it makes sense to put as many small cuts
as possible on a big roll. We could therefore identify &lt;em&gt;saturating patterns&lt;/em&gt;,
that is, a combination of small cuts fitting on a big roll, such that no
additional cut can be placed, and then find the smallest combination of the
pattern satisfying the demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One problem remains: it is impossible to compute, or even to store in memory all
patterns, their number is exponentially big with the number of cuts, so we will
try to find the best patterns and re-solve the problem, using the fact that not
all possible patterns will be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly what the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition does, it splits the problem
into a &lt;strong&gt;Master Problem MP&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;sub-problem SP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Master Problem, provided a set of patterns, will find the best combination
satisfying the demand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The sub-problem, given an &amp;ldquo;importance&amp;rdquo; of each cut provided by the master
problem, will find the best cuts to put on a new pattern.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an iterative process, we can start with some naive patterns we can think
of, compute an initial solution for the master problem, which will be feasible
but not optimal, move on to the sub-problem to try to find a new pattern
(or column in the optimization jargon, hence the term of column generation).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we define the &amp;ldquo;importance&amp;rdquo; of a cut $j$? The value of the &lt;em&gt;dual variable&lt;/em&gt;
associated with this constraint will tell us that. This is not a lecture in
duality theory, math-eager readers can check out further documentation on the
cutting stock problem and duality in linear optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, we are going to add one element to our model: excess cuts can be sold
at a price $P_j$, so that we can optimize by minimizing the net cost (production
cost of the big rolls minus the revenue from excess cuts).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-formulation&#34;&gt;New formulation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, we are going to formulate first possible decisions and
then constraints on these decisions for the new version of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;decisions&#34;&gt;Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the master problem level, given a pattern $p$, the decision will be
$\theta_p$ (theta, yes Greek letters are awesome), the number of big rolls which
will be used with this pattern. $\theta_p$ is a positive integer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision at the sub-problem level will be to find how many of each cut $j$
to fit onto one big roll, $a_j$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a pattern $p$, the number of times a cut $j$ appears is given by $a_{jp}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;constraints&#34;&gt;Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The big roll size constraint is kept in the sub-problem, a pattern built
has to respect this constraint:
$$ \sum_j a_{j} \cdot W_j \leq L $$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demand $D_j$ is met with all rolls of each pattern so it is kept at the master
level. The number of cuts of type $j$ produced is the sum of the number of this
cut on each patterns times the number of the pattern in a solution:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$ NumCuts_j = \sum_p a_{jp} \cdot \theta_p \geq D_j$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;objective-formulation&#34;&gt;Objective formulation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the master problem, we minimize the number of rolls, which is simply:
$$ \sum_{p} \theta_p $$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the sub-problem, we are trying to maximize the gain associated with the need
for the demand + the residual price of the cuts. If we can find a worth using
producing compared to its production cost, it is added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementation&#34;&gt;Implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As before, we will formulate the master and sub-problem using Julia with JuMP.
Again, we use the Clp and Cbc open-source solvers.
We read the problem data (prices, sizes, demand) from a JSON file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using JuMP
using Cbc: CbcSolver
using Clp: ClpSolver
import JSON

const res = open(&amp;quot;data0.json&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;r&amp;quot;) do f
    data = readstring(f)
    JSON.Parser.parse(data)
end

const maxwidth = res[&amp;quot;maxwidth&amp;quot;]
const cost = res[&amp;quot;cost&amp;quot;]
const prices = Float64.(res[&amp;quot;prices&amp;quot;])
const widths = Float64.(res[&amp;quot;widths&amp;quot;])
const demand = Float64.(res[&amp;quot;demand&amp;quot;])
const nwidths = length(prices)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cost&lt;/code&gt; is the production cost of a big roll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;sub-problem&#34;&gt;Sub-problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subproblem is a function taking reduced costs of each cut and maximizing
the utility of the pattern it creates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;    subproblem tries to find the best feasible pattern
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;    maximizing reduced cost and respecting max roll width
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;    corresponding to a multiple-item knapsack

&lt;h3 id=&#34;initial-master-problem&#34;&gt;Initial master problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw that the master problem finds a solution and then requires a new pattern
from the sub-problem. This is therefore preferable to start from an initial
feasible, otherwise we fall into a special case we&amp;rsquo;re not discussing here.
One initial solution would be to build one pattern per cut, with as many cuts as
we can, which is $floor(L/w_j)$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can compute the reduced costs from the dual values associated with the
demand and the prices of cuts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;putting-it-all-together&#34;&gt;Putting it all together&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can now build a column generation function putting all elements together and
performing the main iteration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;New&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;reduced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;cost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the cost of a new pattern is negative, we can add it to the master and
keep running. This seems to make sense. Now, one thing to note, we have not
yet specified the &lt;strong&gt;integrality&lt;/strong&gt; constraints, meaning that we don&amp;rsquo;t have integer
number of patterns. We can see that on the $\theta$ variable:
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;θ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3.98&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;21.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;5.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;31.12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;61.12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;33.58&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;32.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;44.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;46.88&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;19.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1.88&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;16.42&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;θ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;446.1000000000001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We saw in the last post that the problem without integrality constraints is
a relaxation and therefore, can only yield a better result. This means that we
cannot have an integer solution using 446 big rolls or less, the minimum will
be 447 rolls. Let&amp;rsquo;s solve the problem with the same patterns, but adding the
integrality:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# compute initial integer solution:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;# take worse case from linear solution, round up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;intial_integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;ceil&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;θ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;    From patterns built in the column generation phase, find an integer solution
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;branched_model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;demand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;rollcost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;prices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;npatts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;initial_point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;zeros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;npatts&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see what the results look like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;θ_final&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;branched_model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;patterns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;demand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;cost&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;prices&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;initial_point&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;intial_integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;status&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Optimal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;θ_final&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;447&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given that we cannot do better than 447, we know we have the optimal
number of rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing what a mess integer problems can be in the first part, we used a
powerful technique called Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition, spliting the problem into
master and sub-problem, each handling a subset of the constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Column generation is a technique making this decomposition usable in practice,
by adding only one or few columns (patterns) at each iteration, we avoid
an exponentially growing number of variables. The fact that JuMP is built as
an embedded Domain Specific Language in Julia makes it a lot easier to specify
problems and play around them. Most optimization specific modeling languages
are built around declarative features and get messy very quickly when
introducing some logic (like column generation iterations). Developers
could relate this technique to lazy value computation: we know all values are
there, but we just compute them whenever needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed reading this second post on the cutting stock problem. A
Jupyter notebook summing up all code snippets can be found at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/matbesancon/column_generation_jump&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this repository&lt;/a&gt;.
Feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/matbesancon&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ping me&lt;/a&gt; for feedback!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;note-on-performance&#34;&gt;Note on performance&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The column generation approach we just saw scales well to huge problems, but
this particular implementation can feel a bit slow at first. One recommended
thing is to do in such case is &amp;ldquo;warm-starting&amp;rdquo; the solver: give it a good
initial solution to start from. Since we built both the master and subproblem
as stateless functions, the model is being re-built from scratch each time.
The advantage is that any solver can be used, since some of them don&amp;rsquo;t support
warm starts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Aristide for his very sharp ideas and views on this article which
contributed to its improvement!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Integer optimization often feels weird (at least to me). Simple reformulations
of a (mixed) integer optimization problem (MIP) can make it way easier to solve.
We&amp;rsquo;re going to explore one well-known example of such integer problem in two
blog posts. This first part introduces the problem and develops a naive solution.
We&amp;rsquo;re going to see why it&amp;rsquo;s complex to solve and why this formulation does not
scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a second post, we will see a reformulation of the problem which makes it
easier to solve and scales to bigger instances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;integer-optimization-reminder&#34;&gt;Integer optimization reminder&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An optimization problem takes three components: decisions variables $x$, a set of
constraints telling you if a decision is feasible or not and a cost function
$c(x)$ giving a total cost of a decision. Optimization is a domain of applied
mathematics consisting in finding the best feasible decision for a problem.
Lots of decision problems come with &lt;em&gt;integrality constraints&lt;/em&gt;: if $x$ is the
decision, then it can only take integer values 0,1,2&amp;hellip; or even only binary
values ${0,1}$. Think of problems involving number of units produced
for a good, yes/no decisions, etc&amp;hellip; If a problem has lots of variables, naive
enumerations of feasible solutions becomes impossible: even problems with 50
variables can make your average laptop crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cutting-stock-problem&#34;&gt;The cutting stock problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is not new and has been given quite some thoughts because of its
different industrial applications, it has been one of the first applications of
the column generation method we are going to use. The key elements of the problems
are: given some large rolls (metal, paper or other), we need to cut smaller
portions of given lengths to satisfy a demand for the different small lengths.
Find &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;more details here&lt;/a&gt;.
A small instance might be: given rolls of size $100cm$, we want to cut at least
7 rolls of size $12cm$ and 9 rolls of size $29cm$. The objective is to minimize
the number of big rolls to satisfy this demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we formulate this mathematically?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;decisions&#34;&gt;Decisions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$Y_i$ is a binary decision indicating if we use the big roll number $i$. $X_{ij}$ is an integer
giving the number of times we cut a small roll $j$ in the big roll $i$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;constraints&#34;&gt;Constraints&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$Y$ are binary variables, $X$ are integer. Now the less trivial constraints:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demand satisfaction constraint&lt;/strong&gt;: the sum over all $i$ big rolls of the cut $j$
has to satisfy the demand for that cut:
$$\sum_{i} X_{ij} \geq D_j $$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the two-cut example with the demand of $7 \times 12cm$ and $9 \times 29cm$,
let&amp;rsquo;s suppose we have 10 big rolls $i \in {1&amp;hellip;10}$, the demand for the first
12cm cut is 7 cuts, the number of cuts of this size produced is:
$$ \sum_i X_{i1} =  X_{1,1} + X_{2,1} + &amp;hellip; + X_{10,1}$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This total must at least match the demand, so:
$$ X_{1,1} + X_{2,1} + &amp;hellip; + X_{10,1} \geq 7 $$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roll size constraint&lt;/strong&gt;: if a roll $i$ is used, we cannot fit more width
onto it than its total width:
$$\sum_{j} X_{ij} \cdot W_j \leq L \cdot Y_i $$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the two-cut example with the demand of $7 \times 12cm$ and $9 \times 29cm$,
let&amp;rsquo;s suppose we have one roll $i$:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $Y_i = 0$, the roll size constraint becomes:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$ \sum_{j} X_{ij} \cdot W_j = 12 \cdot X_{i1} + 29 \cdot X_{i2} \leq 0 $$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only feasible solution for this roll $i$ is ($X_{i1} = 0,X_{i2} = 0$).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If $Y_i = 1$, the roll size constraint becomes:
$$ 12 \cdot X_{i1} + 29 \cdot X_{i2} \leq 100 $$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means we can fit as many cuts as the roll size allows for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-first-naive-implementation&#34;&gt;A first naive implementation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s first import the necessary packages: we&amp;rsquo;re using JuMP as a modeling
tool, which is an optimization-specific language embedded in Julia
(compare it to AMPL, GAMS, Pyomo, PuLP).
As I consider it an embedded language, I&amp;rsquo;ll do a full import into my namespace
with &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt; (unlike what I usually do with packages). We also use &lt;code&gt;Cbc&lt;/code&gt;,
an open-source solver for integer problems from the Coin-OR suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;JuMP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Cbc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;CbcSolver&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can define our optimization problem within a function taking the parameters
of the cutting stock problem, namely a &lt;code&gt;maxwidth&lt;/code&gt; of the big rolls, scalar
assuming all of them have the same width, a &lt;code&gt;widths&lt;/code&gt; vector, one element for
each cut size $j$ and a &lt;code&gt;demand&lt;/code&gt; vector, again, one for each cut size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;cutting_stock_model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;maxwidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;widths&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;demand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;demand&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here $N$ has to be an upper bound on the number of big rolls to use, otherwise
the problem will be infeasible (not enough big rolls to find a solution
satisfying the demand). An initial naive value for this could be the total
demand, after all one small cut per roll can be considered a worst-case solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we don&amp;rsquo;t call &lt;code&gt;solve&lt;/code&gt; on the model yet, the function simply builds the
model, this will help us see how it evolves with various entry parameters.
In Julia REPL, or by using the &lt;code&gt;@show&lt;/code&gt; macro, we can have more details on the
model. Using &lt;code&gt;println(m)&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;@show&lt;/code&gt; will build a mathematical
formulation of the model in a LateX-like style, which can be valuable to

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see the number of variables and constraints explode as we add more possible
cut sizes. More precisely:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of variables: $ size(X) + size(Y) = Nrolls \cdot Ncuts + Nrolls $&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number of constraints: $ size(DemandConstr) + size(WidthConstr) = Ncuts + Nrolls$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without going into details on the solving process, two things make the problem
difficult to solve:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Symmetry: if we place cuts on a roll $Y_1$ and leave another $Y_2$ unused,
the resulting solution is concretely the same as using $Y_2$ and leaving $Y_1$
unused.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad relaxation: integer solvers mostly work by solving a &amp;ldquo;relaxed&amp;rdquo; version
of the problem without the integrality constraint, and then iteratively
restricting the problem to find the best integer solution. If the relaxed
version of the problem yields solutions far away from an integer one, the solver
will have more work to get there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Difficulty (1) is pretty intuitive, but we could get some insight on (2).
Let&amp;rsquo;s define our relaxed problem. We&amp;rsquo;re going to use the &lt;code&gt;Clp&lt;/code&gt; solver, which
will solve the same problem, but without the &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; restriction for $X$
nor the &lt;code&gt;Bin&lt;/code&gt; restriction for $Y$:

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;7.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.144&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;8.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We notice the $Y$ variables are overall pretty saturated and almost integer,
but the $X$ variables are highly fractional: the linear cuts are divided such
that they fit perfectly the big rolls. This will make the variable hard to
get to an integer solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a quick intro to the cutting stock problem to get a grasp of its
structure and difficulty, the goal was not to get too technical and keep a
broad target audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope you enjoyed it, if that&amp;rsquo;s the case, I&amp;rsquo;ll see you on the next article,
we&amp;rsquo;ll implement a &lt;em&gt;column generation&lt;/em&gt; algorithm from scratch to solve it.
If you have any question/remarks, feel free to &lt;a href=&#34;http://twitter.com/matbesancon/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;get in touch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;thanks&#34;&gt;Thanks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/SohamTamba&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Soham&lt;/a&gt; and Aristide
for their feedback, these helped me a great deal simplify the structure and add
details and explanations where needed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;With the end-of-year celebrations, we all had some expenses to manage,
some of them shared with friends, and we all have this eternal problem
of splitting them fairly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Les bons comptes font les bons amis.&lt;/em&gt;
French wisdom&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applications like &lt;a href=&#34;https://tricount.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Tricount&lt;/a&gt; or
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.splitwise.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Splitwise&lt;/a&gt; became famous precisely by
solving this problem for you: just enter the expenses one by one, with who
owes whom and you&amp;rsquo;ll get the simplest transactions to balance the amounts at
the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll model the expense balancing problem from a graph
perspective and see how to come up with a solution using Julia and the
JuliaGraphs ecosystem [1].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We will use the awesome GraphCoin as a currency in this post, noted GPHC to
be sure no one feels hurt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#trying-out-our-solution&#34;&gt;Trying out our solution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion-perspective-and-note-on-gphc&#34;&gt;Conclusion, perspective and note on GPHC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;


&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-expenses-model&#34;&gt;The expenses model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Say that we have $n$ users involved in the expenses. An expense
$\delta$ is defined by an amount spent $\sigma$, the user who paid the
expense $p$ and a non-empty set of users who are accountable for
this expense $a$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\delta = (\sigma, p, a)$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The total of all expenses $\Sigma$ can be though of as: for any two users $u_i$ and $u_j$,
the total amount that $u_i$ spent for $u_j$. So the expenses are a vector of
triplets &lt;em&gt;(paid by, paid for, amount)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an example, if I went out for
pizza with Joe and paid 8GPHC for the two of us, the expense is modeled as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\delta = (\sigma: 8GPHC, p: Mathieu, a: [Mathieu, Joe])$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now considering I don&amp;rsquo;t keep track of money I owe myself, the sum of all expenses
is the vector composed of one triplet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$\Sigma = [(Mathieu, Joe, \frac{8}{2} = 4)]$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Julia, the expense information can be translated to a structure:
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;GraphCoin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Float16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Expense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;payer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;amount&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;GraphCoin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;User&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reducing-expenses&#34;&gt;Reducing expenses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a full representation of the expenses,
the purpose of balancing is to find a vector of transactions which cancels out
the expenses. A naive approach would be to use the transposed expense matrix
as a transaction matrix. If $u_i$ paid $\Sigma_{i,j}$ for $u_j$,
then $u_j$ paying back that exact amount to $u_i$ will solve the problem.
So we need in the worst case as many transactions after the trip as
$|u| \cdot (|u| - 1)$. For 5 users, that&amp;rsquo;s already 20 transactions,
how can we improve it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;breaking-strongly-connected-components&#34;&gt;Breaking strongly connected components&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose that I paid the pizza slice to Joe for 4GPHC, but he bought me an ice
cream for 2GPHC the day after. In the naive models, we would have two
transactions after the trip: he give me 4GPHC and I would give him 2GPHC. That
does not make any sense, he should simply pay the difference between what he
owes me and what I owe him. For any pair of users, there should only be
at most one transaction from the most in debt to the other, this result in the
worst case of $\frac{|u| \cdot (|u| - 1)}{2}$ transactions, so 10 transactions
for 5 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now imagine I still paid 4GPHC for Joe, who paid 2GPHC for Marie, who paid 4GPHC
for me. In graph terminology, this is called a
&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;strongly connected component&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.
The point here is that transactions will flow from one user to the next one,
and back to the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is a cycle, we can find the minimal due sum within it. In our 3-people
case, it is 2GPHC. That&amp;rsquo;s the amount which is just moving from hand to hand and
back at the origin: it can be forgotten. This yields a new net debt:
I paid 2GPHC for Joe, Marie paid 2GPHC for me. We reduced the number of
transactions and the amount due thanks to this cycle reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;expenses-as-a-flow-problem&#34;&gt;Expenses as a flow problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To simplify the problem, we can notice we don&amp;rsquo;t actually care about who paid
whom for what, a fair reimbursement plan only requires two conditions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All people who are owed some money are given at least that amount&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People who owe money don&amp;rsquo;t pay more than the net amount they ought to pay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can define a directed flow network with users split in two sets of vertices,
depending on whether they owe or are owed money. We call these two sets $V_1$
and $V_2$ respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is an edge from any node of $V_1$ to any node of $V_2$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We define a &lt;em&gt;source&lt;/em&gt; noted $s$ connected to all vertices in $V_1$, the edge
from $s$ to any node of $V_1$ has a capacity equal to what they owe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We define a &lt;em&gt;sink&lt;/em&gt; noted $t$ to which all vertices in $V_2$ connect, with
infinite capacity and a demand (the minimal flow that has to pass through) equal
to what they are owed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this model, GraphCoins will flow from user owing money to users who are
owed money, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wikipedia description of the flow problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;computing-net-owed-amount-per-user&#34;&gt;Computing net owed amount per user&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a vector of expenses, we should be able to build the matrix holding what
is owed in net from a user to another:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;    Builds the matrix of net owed GraphCoins
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;compute_net_owing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;expenses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Vector&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Expense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;nusers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;owing_matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;zeros&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;GraphCoin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;nusers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;nusers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;expense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;expenses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;expense&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;users&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;net_owing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;GraphCoin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From that matrix, we should determine the net amount any user owes or is owed:
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;    What is owed to a given user (negative if user owes money)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;net_owed_user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;net_owing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;GraphCoin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;net_owing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;net_owing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;))[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; function used with &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt; sums a matrix over its rows, columns
respectively. This computes a difference between what a user is owed and what
they owe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;building-the-graph-and-the-corresponding-flow-problem&#34;&gt;Building the graph and the corresponding flow problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flow problem is determined by the directed graph (nodes and directed edges),
the minimal flow for any edge, a maximal flow or capacity for any edge and a
cost of having a certain flow going through each edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need to import LightGraphs, the core package of the JuliaGraph
ecosystem containing essential types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34;&gt;import LightGraphs; const lg = LightGraphs
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that I use explicit package import (not &lt;code&gt;using&lt;/code&gt;), an habit I
kept from using Python and that I consider more readable than importing
the whole package into the namespace. &lt;code&gt;lg&lt;/code&gt; has become my usual name for the
LightGraphs package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;build_graph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;net_owing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Matrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;GraphCoin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;nusers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;net_owing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;source&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;nusers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This function builds our graph structure and all informations we need attached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;solving-the-flow-problem&#34;&gt;Solving the flow problem&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that the components are set, we can solve the problem using another
component of the JuliaGraphs ecosystem specialized for flow problems:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;using LightGraphsFlows: mincost_flow
using Clp: ClpSolver
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need a Linear Programming solver to pass to the flow solver, all we
have to do is bundle the pieces together:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;flow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We truncate the &lt;code&gt;flow&lt;/code&gt; matrix because we are only interested in what users
are paying each other, not in the flows from and to the source and sink.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion-perspective-and-note-on-gphc&#34;&gt;Conclusion, perspective and note on GPHC&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We managed to model our specific problem using &lt;em&gt;LightGraphs.jl&lt;/em&gt; and the
associated flow package pretty easily. I have to admit being biased since
I contributed to the JuliaGraphs ecosystem, if your impression is different
or if you have some feedback, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to file an issue on the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JuliaGraphs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;corresponding package&lt;/a&gt;, some awesome people
will help you figure things out as they helped me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one thing we ignored in our model, it&amp;rsquo;s the number of transactions
realized. Using this as an objective turns the problem into a
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming#Variants&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mixed-Integer Linear Programming&lt;/a&gt; one,
which are much harder to solve and cannot use simple flow techniques. However,
I still haven&amp;rsquo;t found a case where our simple approach does not yield the
smallest number of transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Final word: I started the idea of this article long before the crypto-madness
(September actually), when currencies where still considered as boring,
nerdy or both, sorry about following the (late) hype. I even changed
GraphCoin symbol to GPHC because I found another one with which my initial
name conflicted.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DifferentialEquations.jl - part 2: decision from the model</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2017-12-14-diffeq-julia&#34;&gt;last article&lt;/a&gt;, we explored different modeling options for a
three-component systems which could represent the dynamics of a chemical
reaction or a disease propagation in a population. Building on top of this
model, we will formulate a desirable outcome and find a decision which
maximizes this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the packages imported in the last post,
we will also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/robertfeldt/BlackBoxOptim.jl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BlackBoxOptim.jl&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;DifferentialEquations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;DiffEq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;DifferentialEquations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Plots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Optim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-model&#34;&gt;The model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same chemical system with three components, A, B and R will be used:
$$A + B → 2B$$  $$B → R$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reactor where the reaction occurs must remain active for one minute.
Let&amp;rsquo;s imagine that $B$ is our valuable component while $R$ is a waste.
We want to maximize the quantity of $B$ present within the system after one
minute, that&amp;rsquo;s the objective function. For that purpose, we can choose to add
a certain quantity of new $A$ within the reactor at any point.
$$t_{inject} ∈ [0,t_{final}]$$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;implementing-the-injection&#34;&gt;Implementing the injection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is one major feature of DifferentialEquations.jl we haven&amp;rsquo;t explored yet:
the &lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/features/callback_functions.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;event handling system&lt;/a&gt;.
This allows for the system state to change at a particular point in time,
depending on conditions on the time, state, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/DiffEq/inject.png&#34; alt=&#34;Injection simulation&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ContinuousCallback&lt;/code&gt; construct is the central element here, it takes as
information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When to trigger the event, implemented as the &lt;code&gt;condition&lt;/code&gt; function. It triggers
when this function reaches 0, which is here the case when $t = t_0$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What to do with the state at that moment. The state is encapsulated within
the &lt;em&gt;integrator&lt;/em&gt; variable. In our case, we add 30 units to the concentration in &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we can see on the plot, a discontinuity appears on the concentration in A
at the injection time, the concentration in B restarts increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-optimal-injection-time-visual-approach&#34;&gt;Finding the optimal injection time: visual approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the previously built function, we can get the whole solution with a given
injection time, and from that the final state of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;tinj_span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.05&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.005&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.95&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Plots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;tinj_span&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;final_b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a plain for comprehension, we fetch the solution of the simulation for
the callback built with each $t_{inject}$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/DiffEq/optimal_inject.png&#34; alt=&#34;Quantity of B&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Injecting $A$ too soon lets too much time for the created $B$ to turn into $R$,
but injecting it too late does not let enough time for $B$ to be produced from
the injected $A$. The optimum seems to be around ≈ 0.82,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;finding-the-optimum-using-optim-jl&#34;&gt;Finding the optimum using Optim.jl&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package requires an objective function which takes a vector as input.
In our case, the decision is modeled as a single variable (the injection time),
&lt;strong&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to make the objective use a vector nonetheless&lt;/strong&gt;, otherwise
calling the solver will just explode with cryptic errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;compute_finalb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;tinj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;inject_new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;tinj&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Optim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;optimize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;compute_finalb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We get a detailed result of the optimization including the method and iterations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;* Algorithm: Brent&#39;s Method
* Search Interval: [0.100000, 0.900000]

* Iterations: 13
* Convergence: max(|x - x_upper|, |x - x_lower|) &amp;lt;= 2*(1.5e-08*|x|+2.2e-16): true
* Objective Function Calls: 14
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;inject_new&lt;/code&gt; we defined above returns the complete solution
of the simulation, we get the state matrix &lt;code&gt;u&lt;/code&gt;, from which we extract the
final state &lt;code&gt;u[end]&lt;/code&gt;, and then the second component, the concentration in
B: &lt;code&gt;u[end][2]&lt;/code&gt;. The optimization algorithm minimizes the objective, while we want
to maximize the final concentration of B, hence the -1 multiplier used for&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;compute_finalb&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use the Optim.jl package because our function is twice differentiable,
the best improvement direction is easy to compute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;extending-the-model&#34;&gt;Extending the model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision over one variable was pretty straightforward. We are going to
extend it by changing how the $A$ component is added at $t_{inject}$.
Instead of being completely dissolved, a part of the component will keep being
poured in after $t_{inject}$. So the decision will be composed of two variables:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The time of the beginning of the injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The part of $A$ to inject directly and the part to inject in a
continuous fashion. We will note the fraction injected directly $\delta$.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given a fixed available quantity $A₀$ and a fraction to inject directly $\delta$,
the concentration in A is increased of $\delta \cdot A₀$ at time $t_{inject}$,
after which the rate of change of the concentration in A is increased by a
constant amount, until the total amount of A injected (directly and over time)
is equal to the planned quantity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need a new variable in the state of the system, $u_4(t)$, which stands
for the input flow of A being active or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$u(t) = 0$ if $t &amp;lt; t_{inject}$&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$u(t) = 0$ if the total flow of A which has been injected is equal to the planned quantity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;$u(t) = \dot{A}\ $ otherwise, with $\dot{A}\ $ the rate at which A is being poured.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-julia-equations&#34;&gt;New Julia equations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We already built the key components in the previous sections. This time we need
two events:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A is directly injected at $t_{inject}$, and then starts being poured at constant rate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A stops being poured when the total quantity has been used&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Plots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;inject_progressive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can notice &lt;code&gt;callback_start&lt;/code&gt; being identical to the model we previously built,
while &lt;code&gt;condition_end&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the time when the total injected
quantity reaches &lt;code&gt;inj_quantity&lt;/code&gt;. The first events activates $u_4$ and sets it
to the nominal flow, while the second callback resets it to 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Optim.jl can be re-used to determine the optimal decision:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result details are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrap our function in a &lt;code&gt;Optim.OnceDifferentiable&lt;/code&gt; to provide Optim with the
information that the function is differentiable, even though we don&amp;rsquo;t provide a
gradient, it can be computed by automatic differentiation or finite differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The optimal solution corresponds to a complete direct injection
($\delta \approx 1$) with $t_{inject}^{opt}$ identical to the previous model.
This means pouring the A component in a continuous fashion does not allow to
produce more $B$ at the end of the minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could still built on top of this model to keep refining it, taking more
phenomena into account (what if the reactions produce heat and are sensitive
to temperature?). The structures describing models built with
DifferentialEquations.jl are transparent and easy to use for further manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One point on which I place expectations is some additional interoperability
between DifferentialEquations.jl and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JuMP&lt;/a&gt;,
a Julia meta-package for optimization. Some great work was already performed to
combine the two systems, one use case that has been described is the parameter
identification problem (given the evolution of concentration in the system,
identify the α and β parameters).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But given that the function I built from a parameter was a black box
(without an explicit formula, not a gradient), I had to use BlackBoxOptim,
which is amazingly straightforward, but feels a bit overkill for smooth
functions as presented here. Maybe there is a different way to build the
objective function, using parametrized functions for instance, which could
make it transparent to optimization solvers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If somebody has info on that last point or feedback, additional info you&amp;rsquo;d like
to share regarding this post, hit me on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/matbesancon&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.
Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2018-01-31:&lt;br /&gt;
I updated this post to adapt to the new DifferentialEquations.jl
interface. I also used Optim.jl for the two cases without BlackBoxOptim.jl,
which is very nice but not neccesary for differentiable functions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pkofod&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Patrick&lt;/a&gt; for his quick response
and help with &lt;code&gt;Optim.jl&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2017-12-20:&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, BlackBoxOptim.jl was not the most appropriate algorithm as
predicted. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/pkofod&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Patrick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ChrisRackauckas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;
gave me some hints in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/matbesancon/status/943662063074906112&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;
and I gave &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JuliaNLSolvers/Optim.jl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Optim.jl&lt;/a&gt; a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This package has a range of algorithms to choose from depending on the
structure of the function and the knowledge of its gradient and Hessian.
The goal is continuous optimization, (as opposed to BlackBoxOptim.jl which supports
more exotic search spaces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding the optimum $t_{inject}$ of the first problem is pretty simple:
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Optim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Optim&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;optimize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;compute_finalb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This yields the following information:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14 calls to the objective function, pretty neat compared to the hundreds of
BlackBoxOptim. We also confirm the optimum of &lt;code&gt;0.8355891&lt;/code&gt;. Not yet sure we could
use Optim.jl for the second case (boxed multivariate optimization without explicit gradient).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DifferentialEquations.jl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DifferentialEquations.jl&lt;/a&gt;
came to be a key component of Julia&amp;rsquo;s scientific ecosystem. After checking the
JuliaCon talk of its creator, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to start building stuff with it,
so I created and developed a simple example detailed in this blog post.
Starting from a basic ordinary differential equation (ODE), we add noise,
making it stochastic, and finally turn it into a discrete version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before running the code below, two imports will be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;DifferentialEquations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;DiffEq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;DifferentialEquations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Plots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to prefer explicit imports in Julia code, it helps to see from which
part each function and type comes. As &lt;code&gt;DifferentialEquations&lt;/code&gt; is longuish to
write, we use an alias in the rest of the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-model&#34;&gt;The model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We use a simple 3-element state in a differential equation. Depending on your
background, pick the interpretation you prefer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An SIR model, standing for susceptible, infected, and recovered, directly
inspired by the talk and by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sdwfrost/Gillespie.jl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gillespie.jl&lt;/a&gt;
package. We have a total population with healthy people, infected people
(after they catch the disease) and recovered (after they heal from the disease).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A chemical system with three components, A, B and R.
$$A + B → 2B$$  $$B → R$$&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After searching my memory for chemical engineering courses and the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocatalysis&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;universal source of knowledge&lt;/a&gt;,
I could confirm the first reaction is an autocatalysis, while the second is
a simple reaction. An autocatalysis means that B molecules turn A molecules
into B, without being consumed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first example is easier to represent as a discrete problem: finite
populations make more sense when talking about people. However, it can be seen
as getting closer to a continuous differential equation as the number of people
get higher. The second model makes more sense in a continuous version as we are
dealing with concentrations of chemical components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-first-continuous-model&#34;&gt;A first continuous model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the tutorials from the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/tutorials/ode_example.html#Example-2:-Solving-Systems-of-Equations-1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;official package website&lt;/a&gt;,
we can build our system from:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A system of differential equations: how does the system behave (dynamically)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Initial conditions: where does the system start&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A time span: how long do we want to observe the system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The system state can be written as:
$$u(t) =
\begin{bmatrix}
u₁(t) \&lt;br /&gt;
u₂(t) \&lt;br /&gt;
u₃(t)&lt;br /&gt;
\end{bmatrix}^T
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the behavior described as:
$$
\dot{u}(t) = f(u,t)
$$
And the initial conditions $u(0) = u₀$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Julia with DifferentialEquations, this becomes:
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;α&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;diffeq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;du&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;du&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;α&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;du&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;α&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;du&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;β&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;u₀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;49.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;tspan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1.0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;diffeq&lt;/code&gt; models the dynamic behavior, &lt;code&gt;u₀&lt;/code&gt; the starting conditions
and &lt;code&gt;tspan&lt;/code&gt; the time range over which we observe the system
evolution. Note that the &lt;code&gt;diffeq&lt;/code&gt; function also take a &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; argument for parameters,
in which we could have stored $\alpha$ and $\beta$.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that our equation is smooth, so we&amp;rsquo;ll let
&lt;code&gt;DifferentialEquations.jl&lt;/code&gt; figure out the solver. The general API
of the package is built around two steps:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Building a problem/model from behavior and initial conditions
2. Solving the problem using a solver of our choice and providing additional
information on how to solve it, yielding a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;prob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;DiffEq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;ODEProblem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;diffeq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;u₀&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;tspan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;sol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;DiffEq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;prob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One very nice property of solutions produced by the package is that they
contain a direct way to produce plots. This is fairly common in Julia to
implement methods from other packages, here the &lt;code&gt;ODESolution&lt;/code&gt; type implements
Plots.plot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-julia&#34; data-lang=&#34;julia&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Plots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;sol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/DiffEq/smooth.png&#34; alt=&#34;Solution to the ODE&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we use the disease propagation example, $u₁(t)$ is the number of
healthy people who haven&amp;rsquo;t been infected. It starts high, which makes the rate
of infection by the diseased population moderate. As the number of sick people
increases, the rate of infection increases: there are more and more possible
contacts between healthy and sick people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the number of sick people increases, the recovery rate also increases,
absorbing more sick people. So the &amp;ldquo;physics&amp;rdquo; behind the problem makes sense
with what we observe on the curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key property to notice is the mass conservation: the sum of the three elements
of the vector is constant (the total population in the health case). This makes
sense from the point of view of the equations:
$$\frac{du₁}{dt} + \frac{du₂}{dt} + \frac{du_3}{dt} = 0$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-randomness-first-attempt-with-a-simple-sde&#34;&gt;Adding randomness: first attempt with a simple SDE&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous model works successfully, but remains naive. On small populations,
the rate of contamination and recovery cannot be so smooth. What if some sick
people isolate themselves from others for an hour or so, what there is a
meeting organized, with higher chances of contacts? All these plausible events
create different scenarios that are more or less likely to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To represent this, the rate of change of the three variables of the system
can be considered as composed of a deterministic part and of a random variation.
One standard representation for this, as laid out in the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/tutorials/sde_example.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;package documentation&lt;/a&gt;
is the following:
$$
du = f(u,t) dt + ∑ gᵢ(u,t) dWᵢ
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, we could consider two points of randomness at the two interactions
(one for the transition from healthy to sick, and one from sick to recovered).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;stochastic-version&#34;&gt;Stochastic version&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that we also change the solver provided to the &lt;code&gt;solve&lt;/code&gt; function to adapt
to stochastic equations. The last variation is set to the opposite of the sum
of the two others to compensate the two other variations (we said we had only
one randomness phenomenon per state transition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/DiffEq/sde.png&#34; alt=&#34;SDE&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Woops, something went wrong. This time the mass conservation doesn&amp;rsquo;t hold,
we finish with a population below the initial condition. What is wrong is that
we don&amp;rsquo;t define the &lt;strong&gt;variation&lt;/strong&gt; but the &lt;em&gt;gᵢ(u,t)&lt;/em&gt; function, which is then
multiplied by &lt;em&gt;dWᵢ&lt;/em&gt;. Since we used the function signature corresponding to
the diagonal noise, there is a random component per $uᵢ$ variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;adding-randomness-second-attempt-with-non-diagonal-noise&#34;&gt;Adding randomness: second attempt with non-diagonal noise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As explained above, we need one source of randomness for each transition.
This results in a $G(u,t)$ matrix of $3 × 2$. We can then make sure that the
the sum of variations for the three variables cancel out to keep a constant
total population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also provide a &lt;code&gt;noise_rate_prototype&lt;/code&gt; parameter to the problem builder to
indicate we don&amp;rsquo;t want to use a diagonal noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/DiffEq/sde_nondiag.png&#34; alt=&#34;SDE&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time the population conservation holds, at any point in time the sum of
the $uᵢ(t)$ remains 50.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discretizing-gillespie-model&#34;&gt;Discretizing: Gillespie model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The models we produced so far represent well the chemical reaction problem,
but a bit less the disease propagation. We are using continuous quantities
to represent discrete populations, how do we interpret 0.6 people sick at a time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One major strength of the package is its effortless integration of discrete
phenomena in a model, alone or combined with continuous dynamics. Our model
follows exactly the package tutorial on
&lt;a href=&#34;http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/tutorials/discrete_stochastic_example.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;discrete stochastic problems&lt;/a&gt;,
so building it should be straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;DiffEq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Direct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;infect_rate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;recover_rate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;disc_sol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;DiffEq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;solve&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;disc_prob&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;DiffEq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;Discrete&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define the infection and recovery rate and the variables $uᵢ$ that are
affected, and call the Discrete solver. The Plots.jl integration once again
yields a direct representation of the solution over the time span.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/DiffEq/discrete.png&#34; alt=&#34;SDE&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, the conservation of the total population is guaranteed by the effect of
the jumps deleting one unit from a population to add it to the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DifferentialEquations.jl package went from a good surprise to a key tool in
my scientific computing toolbox. It does not require learning another embedded
language but makes use of real idiomatic Julia. The interface is clean and
working on edge cases does not feel hacky. I&amp;rsquo;ll be looking forward to using
it in my PhD or side-hacks, especially combined to the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JuMP.jl&lt;/a&gt; package: DifferentialEquations
used to build simulations and JuMP to optimize a cost function on top of the
created model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, get on touch on &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/matbesancon&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;
for feedback or questions ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I updated this post to fit the new DifferentialEquations.jl 4.0 syntax. Some
changes are breaking the previous API, it can be worth it to check it out
&lt;a href=&#34;http://juliadiffeq.org/2018/01/24/Parameters.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in detail&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/ChrisRackauckas&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chris&lt;/a&gt;, the creator and main developer
of DifferentialEquations.jl, gave me valuable tips on two
points which have been edited in the article. You can find the thread
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/matbesancon/status/941825252744507392&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Import aliases should use &lt;code&gt;const PackageAlias = PackageName&lt;/code&gt; for type
stability. This allows the compiler to generate efficient code.
Some further mentions of type-stability can be found in the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/performance-tips&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;official doc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The second attempts uses non-diagonal noise, the &amp;ldquo;:additive&amp;rdquo; hint I passed
to the solve function does not hold. Furthermore, the appropriate algorithm in
that case is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%E2%80%93Maruyama_method&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Euler-Maruyama method&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many thanks to him for these tips, having such devoted and friendly developers
is also what makes an open-source project successful.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Switching my work flow to Pomodoro for grad studies - part I: motivation  </title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The start of my journey as a PhD student last September was a big step, but
also an opportunity to review and improve my working habits. My day time
had to be used properly, both for results&amp;rsquo; sake and to be able to keep
a balanced life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had been introduced to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Pomodoro technique&lt;/a&gt;
at Equisense (thanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/CamilleSaute&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Camille&lt;/a&gt;!) but
remained skeptical as for its potential value within my work
flow at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make it short, the technique consists in the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide what task should be worked on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocate a given time to work (around 25 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set a timer and get to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the time is up, make a short pause (~5 minutes), then repeat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After 4 work sprints, take a longer break (~15-30 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-was-wrong-with-that&#34;&gt;What was wrong with that?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development, test and operation phases were generally self-determining
and lead to sprints from 20 to 120 minutes (that length isn&amp;rsquo;t surprising
for some tasks and when highly focused). These were also often
interrupted by team interactions (required concertation with members
of the tech and product team, backend-specific collaborative
problem-solving, &amp;hellip;). The main point was that
&lt;strong&gt;there are enough spontaneous interruptions of the work flow, no need to introduce an additional artificial one&lt;/strong&gt;.
As I look back, I still think this was a valid reason
not to use this technique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-has-changed&#34;&gt;What has changed?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time management as a grad student has to be un- and re-learned:
rules are different, criteria for success change and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/tomate/phd_time.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time management seen by PhD comics [2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;problem-structure-programming-at-a-startup-vs-applied-math&#34;&gt;Problem structure: programming at a startup vs. applied math&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my case, the major part of the workload switched from an
implementation-heavy to a modeling-heavy context. As such,
the work phases tend to be longer and with an heavier
cognitive load. I am not saying that programming is
easier, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure mathematics almost always
requires to keep more information in mind while working
on a problem. Another opinion is that the part of
instinct to find a path towards a solution is higher
in mathematics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While programming, there are some key techniques that
reduce the number of possible sources to a problem:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting information on the state of the program at a given point (logging, debugging, printing to &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Testing the behavior of an isolated piece of the program with given input&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques also work for scientific computing of course, but are
harder to apply to both modeling and symbolic calculus, the different
pieces of the problem have to be combined to find special structures
which allow for a resolution. More solutions also tend to come
while NOT looking at mathematical problem than for programming
problems, where solutions come either in front of the code or when
voluntarily thinking of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;team-dependent-work-vs-figure-it-out-for-yourself&#34;&gt;Team-dependent work vs. figure it out for yourself&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most startups obviously value team work, it is one of the
group skills that differentiate companies building great
things from the ones stuck in an eternal early stage.
This was even more true at Equisense where collaboration
and product development were both very synchronous by
modern standards. It had cons but ease two things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speed of product development&lt;/strong&gt;. Lots of team under-estimate post-development coordination, the last meters of the sprint to have a feature ready&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Programming by constraints&lt;/strong&gt;. Because of fast interactions between the people responsible for the different components, constraints from each one is quickly communicated and the modeling process is defined accounting for them right away.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now in research, especially in applied mathematics, the work is
mostly independent, synchronization happens when working
on a joined project for instance. This means that all the
interruptions that were happening throughout the day are
now gone!
&lt;strong&gt;Nothing would stop you from working day and night without a break&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two key results of this change of work style are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work sprints are not naturally bound anymore, obviously with decreasing efficiency&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Few to no interactions interrupt the sprints either&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My conclusion was the necessity of a time management technique
and associated tools, with a low cognitive overhead and bringing
as little distraction as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these criteria, I rejected a mobile app,
smartphones are great to bring different sources
of information and communication channels together,
not for remaining focused for hours,
&lt;strong&gt;mobile apps are designed to catch and retain attention&lt;/strong&gt;,
that&amp;rsquo;s simply part of their business model. I also rejected
web-based solutions for the constraint of firing up
a browser, amongst the heaviest pieces of software on our
modern desktops, just to start a working session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So desktop GUI or CLI it is. Even though there is the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://gnomepomodoro.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gnomepomodoro project&lt;/a&gt;, it did not seem compatible with all
Linux desktops. At that point, I realized the amount of
work to build a Pomodoro was low, the requirements and
constraints well known, I throw ideas
together and start coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll explain the initial development and iterations of
the app in Go in a second article, if you liked this one,
let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving my content creation to a home-made Hugo site</title>
      <link>https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2017-09-05-moving-content-hugo/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Last weeks have been pretty intense. I officially left Equisense and  started
a joined PhD project between INRIA Lille and Ecole Polytechnique Montreal.
I had been preparing for this fresh start for several months and also wanted
to evolve in my content creation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-journey-from-plain-markdown-to-hugo&#34;&gt;A journey from plain markdown to Hugo&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started writing articles to keep track of my learning paths on various topics,
including numerical techniques, data analysis and programming. My first articles
were either plain or Rmarkdown-generated Markdowns on a Github repository.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I was slowly moving from R to Python, Jupyter notebook became pretty handy
to mix paragraphs, code snippets, results and charts. It also forced me to
quit declaring and modifying variables, an annoying habit got from always
having a REPL and text editor bundled in most scientific computing IDEs
(Matlab, Scilab, RStudio, Jupyter).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great, the articles were not centralized though but split into their Github
repositories, you have to admit this is not the most user-friendly browsing
experience. I found several blogs running on &lt;a href=&#34;https://jekyllrb.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;
and I decided to give it a try. For someone who is not fond of struggles with
front-end side layout issues, this was a true gift, I could easily reuse
templates from front-end developers and designers (special thanks for the
awesome &lt;a href=&#34;http://hemangsk.github.io/Gravity&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gravity project&lt;/a&gt;)
without much struggle and focus on what I liked: building projects and
writing content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;switching-to-the-writing-platform&#34;&gt;Switching to THE writing platform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I kept maintaining the Jekyll blog until almost exactly one year ago. During
that time, I was mostly writing in the context of a side-project or thinking on
our journey at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.equisense.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Equisense&lt;/a&gt;. This raised new
requirements for the writing process such as collaborative writing, review from
friends, seeing the overall picture we were sending as a team from the sum of
our articles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For these reasons, my articles gradually switched to Medium,
first published as an individual, then on the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/equisense&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Equisense page&lt;/a&gt;. This was a very productive time
for writing as we encouraged one another and had a direct impact on the way we
presented the team, how we work and our learning path: an invaluable tool to
help candidates decide whether the company was a fit for them and to ease the
onboading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;if-medium-works-why-would-anyone-go-back-to-writing-everything-from-scratch&#34;&gt;If Medium works, why would anyone go back to writing everything from scratch?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really enjoy the writing experience on Medium, with some drawbacks.
Medium&amp;rsquo;s design is very opinionated, that&amp;rsquo;s a part of what makes it a experience.
However, leaving some choices on key topics is essential (at least to me) on the
content-creation side.
I believe this should be the case on any two-sided plateform:
&lt;strong&gt;be opinionated on the user-side, leave flexibility on the creator side.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The perfect example is the bright screen. It ensures the Medium experience is
consistent with the unique font, background etc&amp;hellip; But writing on a dark screen
is a lot more comfortable, especially when you&amp;rsquo;re used to it or when your eyes
are more light-sensitive: writing late in the evening or early in the morning
was not conceivable to me on the Medium interface. The hack I used was to write
everything on &lt;a href=&#34;https://atom.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt;, then paste everything to Medium once the
first draft was ready, still a bit of a pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem minor as a reason to switch, but the root behind it is more
essential: &lt;strong&gt;Medium is a platform, you&amp;rsquo;re therefore a user, not an owner&lt;/strong&gt;.
Despite its global success, the company is still young and looking for the
right model. Nothing tells me the model they choose tomorrow will be one I
want to contribute to (how paid content will be managed for instance).
Switching platforms for written content is a lot more tedious than choosing well
at the beginning. This new step in my professional and personal life is the
perfect occasion to rethink that commitment, I will still be re-publishing
content to Medium, but not as the primary source.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Company values: stop trying to dictate who you are</title>
      <link>https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2016-10-7-company-values/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2016-10-7-company-values/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, the Equisense &lt;a href=&#34;http://equisense.com/en/about.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;team&lt;/a&gt; spent a
couple days together near the ocean in northern France. The goal was to get to
know each other better and sit down to (re)think on the way we work, where we
are heading and try to put some words on who we are and how we plan on moving
forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You named it, we tried to define one of the obsessions in the startup culture:
company values. There are many pitfalls to avoid while doing so and any of them
can make the company look as a cliché, under-ambitious or reject some of the
stakeholders. Keep in mind that these values are publicly displayed or at least
talked about, which means your employees, investors and clients could all feel
disconnected from them. At best, their reaction would be
&amp;ldquo;whatever, I guess everybody says so&amp;rdquo; and see you as another cliché.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At worst, they can reject the way you define yourself and consider the
advantages of working with you are not worth it.
But is the second scenario really worse? The scope of such problem is a lot
wider than your external communication and the &amp;ldquo;values&amp;rdquo; tab of your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using Paul Graham&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;definition&lt;/a&gt;,
a startup is all about growth, hence moving
fast. Quick decisions and executions cannot come without breaking things and
building tension on the way. Trying to define values because they make you
sound confident while being agreeable by everyone cannot yield any outcome.
No great result comes out of willing to please everyone, and the corollary is
that &lt;strong&gt;every successful person and organization has haters&lt;/strong&gt;. Given this
statement, the best any entity can do is to choose who is likely not to stick
with them and why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-values-anyway&#34;&gt;Why values anyway?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question is totally legit, especially in countries like France where the
startup culture is still not familiar to a significant part of the population
or like Germany where pragmatism is king in both what you do and how you
communicate it.
Traditional organizations have always had a simple deal on the recruitment side:
lend me your skills and I&amp;rsquo;ll pay you decently. On the clients&amp;rsquo; side, the
&amp;ldquo;values&amp;rdquo; displayed were traditionally associated with product differentiation
(&amp;ldquo;at XYZ, our obsession is to bring the best product to [insert target] at
unbeatable prices&amp;rdquo;).
The shareholders&amp;rsquo; side did not even need big words, a couple KPIs from the last
quarter would do. As &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@Nicolas_Colin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Nicolas Colin&lt;/a&gt; phrases
in several Medium posts, keeping what is being said to each of these
stakeholders completely separated is not possible anymore in the digital age.
That&amp;rsquo;s partly why company&amp;rsquo;s culture and values became central topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve seen two cases at traditional companies. The first situation is ignorance
or non-existence of company values, maybe some of these will sound familiar:
&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Values? No this is the communication staff&amp;rsquo;s business&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re not here to dream, we&amp;rsquo;re paid to get the job done&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second attitude is picking up &amp;ldquo;values&amp;rdquo; corresponding to trends but
completely disconnected from the organization&amp;rsquo;s reality. Just visit the
&lt;a href=&#34;http://cbsg.sf.net&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Corporate bullshit generator&lt;/a&gt; and you will know what I&amp;rsquo;m
referring to:
We&amp;rsquo;ve all seen extremely conservative companies call themselves &amp;ldquo;innovators&amp;rdquo;
or some historical monopolists call themselves &amp;ldquo;disruptive&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what changed with startups? Simple, you can redefine the way your market
works (and sometimes create it in the process) and become the central element
for it. That&amp;rsquo;s an idea you can genuinely believe in, work for and something you
can promise employees, shareholders and clients.
Now where are your values in this? Simply where you want the market to go and
the path you&amp;rsquo;re ready to take to go there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are obviously other factors at stake here, the fact that millennials
need to define themselves through what they do for instance and cannot just
work for a decent paycheck in the same polite colleague relation for 40+ years.
More than ever, our generation needs some sense in what we do at the moment and
not in a 40-year projection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;writing-down-values-is-about-choosing-a-path-and-sticking-to-it&#34;&gt;Writing down values is about choosing a path and sticking to it&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d say this is the main highlight I got from hours of thoughts about the topic
of company values. &lt;strong&gt;Choosing values is not about sounding cool&lt;/strong&gt;, not about
the image you want for the organization&amp;rsquo;s recruitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something concrete? Don&amp;rsquo;t define yourself as hackers if you spend at least as
much time planning as actually trying and building stuff. Don&amp;rsquo;t pretend to
disrupt anything if you&amp;rsquo;re playing the old rules within a known and stable
market. Don&amp;rsquo;t define yourself as transparent if you&amp;rsquo;re not obsessed with
everyone knowing both how you think and operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining yourself through the most trendy terms of the year has lead to a
feeling of emptiness in the messages carried in the startup ecosystems and has
even become one of its
&lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.caranddriver.com/2016-consumer-electronics-show-cutting-through-the-buzzwords-to-what-really-matters/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;clichés&lt;/a&gt;
or even &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-GVd_HLlps&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;jokes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-define-your-company-in-a-non-cliché-way&#34;&gt;How to define your company in a non-cliché way&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t have the pretension to set the rules on this point, simply to match
some great frameworks from people smarter than me who gave this point
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpVCQfImQ1A&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;years of thoughts&lt;/a&gt;
(conference in French by Oussama Ammar) with the annoying points we discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with the hard way: define the cool things you are not. This goes with
a conclusion drawn earlier, every successful organization has haters, but don’t
get the cause-effect relation wrong: your company is not going to reach its
goals once it has haters. It should have haters because it defined a clear path
to success which induced not satisfying every stakeholder on the way. The
corollary is even a stronger conclusion: trying to please every potential
target and stakeholder is the safest way to getting stuck and unable to make
any decision. This is a luxury startups cannot afford by definition. Immobility
can only be explainable in traditional and established businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define your values on the fly: just like you don’t decide as a child that
you are a nice person, you don’t decide as a company that you are disrupters
before living it. Discover your organization as you are working together and
reaching the first painful milestones, these key steps in your development when
you have to decide where priorities are being set and who is not going to
remain supportive afterwards. These tough experiences and the retrospective
understanding of your reaction as a team will make you more confident in what
you are doing and help cut the fluff on things you are not meant to do.
This is the focus everyone needs to move faster and sharper than the
competition, the market and the context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Functional and parallel PageRank implementation in Scala</title>
      <link>https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2016-09-13-page-rank/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 13 Sep 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2016-09-13-page-rank/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;When I &lt;a href=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/posts/2016-08-11-back-to-startup/&#34;&gt;came back to Equisense&lt;/a&gt;,
I was surprised and intrigued by many things. But there was one element of the
job in particular I had not planned: coming back to low level and embedded
programming from higher abstractions I was used to. No OS, no
libraries, no smooth write-and-test work-flow, just brutal and bare metal.
I clearly needed to blow some steam off with something closer to what I
usually do (or did), a data-driven and functional project using nice techs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-yet-another-pagerank&#34;&gt;Why yet another PageRank?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time came to find a new side project and I was just finishing the lectures
of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/learn/parprog1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Parallel Programming&lt;/a&gt;, which I
recommend if you&amp;rsquo;re already at ease with Scala and its environment (IDEs, SBT).
I wanted to apply the concepts on a project built from scratch. One day,
while neglectfully scrolling through another blog post showing the basic
concepts of the PageRank computation, I thought this would make a &amp;ldquo;okay&amp;rdquo; project.
But wait, interesting elements here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The model behind the PageRank computation is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Markov Chain&lt;/a&gt;,
with which I have been working a lot with at Siemens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterating until stability of the ranks is basically a linear flow, easily
performed by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tail call recursion&lt;/a&gt;
which is optimized to avoid stack-overflowing the JVM by behaving like a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Computing the rank of each site is independent of the other computations,
parallelizing the tasks is a piece of cake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we&amp;rsquo;re all set up for a purely functional and parallel PageRank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-pagerank-model&#34;&gt;The PageRank model&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re gonna go through the basic implementation of the algorithm. What
fascinates me is the two-sided view of the algorithm: the intuitive version can
be explained to a 5-year-old (or to your boss) while the maths behind it
relies on the interpretation of matrix eigenvalues and on a computation of the
stationary distribution of the Markov model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-intuitive-version&#34;&gt;The intuitive version&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imagine you&amp;rsquo;re surfing on the web like any productive Sunday evening. On a
given page, there is an equal probability to click on any link present on the
page. There is also a probability that you get tired of the current series of
pages and randomly go back to any page of the network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s try to visualize the two extremes of this &amp;ldquo;random switch&amp;rdquo; usually called
&lt;em&gt;damping factor&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt;. If we set &lt;code&gt;d=0&lt;/code&gt;, the transition to any page is equally
probable, since the surfer will always switch to choosing a page at random.
This means that the links going out of the page they&amp;rsquo;re currently on don&amp;rsquo;t
influence the probability distribution of the next page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the spectrum if the damping factor &lt;code&gt;d=1&lt;/code&gt;, the surfer will
always look for its next page in the outgoing links of her current page
(this raises an issue for pages without any links). An usual value for the
factor is &lt;code&gt;d=0.85&lt;/code&gt;which keeps the probability of long sequences of related pages
likely to happen, but allows for random switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-elements-of-the-algorithm&#34;&gt;Key elements of the algorithm&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The algorithm uses the matrix of links: an entry &lt;code&gt;(i,j)&lt;/code&gt; is 1 if there is a
link on the page &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt; to the page &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and 0 otherwise (note that this notation
is opposite to the common convention for Markov transition matrices, where the
line is the origin state and the column the destination). The other element is
a rank vector which is updated until a convergence criterion is met.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;types-of-the-different-structures&#34;&gt;Types of the different structures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we want to be able to perform some computations in parallel, most
functions will manipulate Scala&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Generic&lt;/em&gt; data structures. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with
the link matrix. It is a sparse structure: instead of representing all
entries of the matrix in a vector of vectors, just non-empty elements and
there corresponding column and line indexes are stored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scala&#34; data-lang=&#34;scala&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// defining a dense matrix of Ints as a sequence of sequence
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;DenseMatrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;GenSeq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;GenSeq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;// SparseMatrix: tuple (line, column, value)
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#75715e&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;SparseMatrix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;GenSeq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the values of our link matrix only contains zeros and ones, so the
entries present in the structure all have one as value, so we just need to keep
rows and columns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scala&#34; data-lang=&#34;scala&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;LinkMat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;GenSeq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ranks are stored in a simple generic float sequence:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scala&#34; data-lang=&#34;scala&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;GenSeq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need a few utility functions. &lt;code&gt;sumElements&lt;/code&gt; takes the matrix, the rank
vector and an integer to find all links for which the outgoing page is &lt;code&gt;j&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scala&#34; data-lang=&#34;scala&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;sumElements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;GenSeq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;LinkMat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;No link in the page &amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34; at sumElements&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;totalLinks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; This implementation of the function is not purely functional since
an imperative system error is raised if no index i is found. A better solution
here would have been to wrap the value in an &lt;code&gt;Option[Float]&lt;/code&gt;, return &lt;code&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; if no
index has been found and &lt;code&gt;Some(x)&lt;/code&gt; in case of success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also need to find all pages pointing to a given page i. This might be a
bit compact, but keep in mind that the matrix is simply a pair of page indexes.
So we find all pages where the first element is i (the page the link is going
to), that&amp;rsquo;s the filter part. We then take the second element of the tuple, so
all indexes pointing to i, thanks to a map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-scala&#34; data-lang=&#34;scala&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;findConnected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;LinkMat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;GenSeq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;Int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;_1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;_2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;toSeq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the result is returned as a normal sequence (not the generic version
allowing for parallel computation). It&amp;rsquo;s not a big deal since the resulting
sequence is always manageable compared to the whole graph we are manipulating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we stated that the algorithm recurses on the rank of all pages until
stability, which is something we define through a &lt;code&gt;converged&lt;/code&gt; function. We
simply use a squared difference between two different versions of the rank to
determine if they are acceptably close and yield a boolean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that everything is set, the master piece becomes a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;newRank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;compRank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;newRank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;damp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;eps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;niter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;niterMax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We first compute the right term of the new rank formula &lt;code&gt;rightRank&lt;/code&gt; and plug it
in &lt;code&gt;newRank&lt;/code&gt;. The two vectors can be passed to &lt;code&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt; to determine if
&lt;code&gt;newRank&lt;/code&gt; can be returned as a final result or if further recursion is needed.
A recursion counter also avoids waiting too long for a result and warns in case
of maximum recursion reached by printing to the standard output.
Once again, a more functional way would have been to wrap the result in a
&lt;code&gt;Try&lt;/code&gt; monad (no panic, we&amp;rsquo;re NOT going to go through monads, we&amp;rsquo;ve lost enough
people with this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve surely noticed the &lt;code&gt;@tailrec&lt;/code&gt; tag highlighting that this function is not
going to blow the stack up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;result-on-a-study-case&#34;&gt;Result on a study case&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-enron-email-dataset&#34;&gt;The Enron email dataset&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While surfing in a semi-random way to find a cool dataset for the application,
I found the &lt;a href=&#34;https://snap.stanford.edu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SNAP&lt;/a&gt; project
from Stanford on which the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Enron.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Enron emails data&lt;/a&gt;
are presented and to be downloaded. If you look at the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/matbesancon/PageRank&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt; for this project, I simply
removed the header from the txt file to make the parsing tasks easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As many phenomena dealing with &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;concentration of resources&lt;/a&gt;,
the distribution of ranks follows a Pareto distribution, which can be
visualized on a log-log scale. I used Python with numpy and matplotlib, finding
the current Scala libraries still to cumbersome for this simple task. Here is
the result:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/pageRank/rankDist.png&#34; alt=&#34;Resulting log-rank&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-conclusion-on-the-functional-imperative-debate&#34;&gt;A conclusion on the functional/imperative debate&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If some of you clone and try to run the project (you&amp;rsquo;ll just need sbt for that).
Some people could argue that the runtime is too long for what it does (whatever
too long means), and that an imperative solution with a mutable rank on which
we loop until convergence. And I suppose they are right, but parallel
imperative is objectively a pain to work with. &lt;strong&gt;Tell the architecture what you
want, not what to do and it will compute it for you, whatever its
configuration is&lt;/strong&gt;, from your laptop to several clusters. That&amp;rsquo;s a key reason
why &lt;a href=&#34;http://spark.apache.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Spark&lt;/a&gt; is functional for instance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Back to startup life: thoughts after the first days</title>
      <link>https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2016-08-11-back-to-startup/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In politics, a government&amp;rsquo;s first decisions and actions are often reviewed and
assessed after the famous first 100 days. According to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_hundred_days&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;,
the term was coined by F. Roosevelt himself. I wanted to throw the first
thoughts on my comeback at Equisense, on culture and operations and the difference
between the two stages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;startups-are-in-a-continuous-headlong-rush&#34;&gt;Startups are in a continuous headlong rush&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll not wait the 100 days to write this post, because in a startup things move
faster, so why wait another month? At the same time you have to remain focused
for a lot longer than three months or the consequences to expect are worse than
skeptical articles or plunging opinion polls. Nobody could judge actions or
decisions drawn after a year in business based on one or even three months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this adrenalined marathon does not (or should not) stop with a first product
release, or worse with a nice fund-raising round. This stops with the company
running out of business or the market saying &amp;ldquo;I love you, let&amp;rsquo;s stay forever
until death do us apart&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-early-insight-before-the-long-break&#34;&gt;An early insight before the long break&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had already worked with the team in June, July and August 2015 during their
three-founders-and-laptops stage. The focus was on first studies of acceleration
signals and feasibility of some features given technological and product choices.
Those first graphs and explanations thrown on a small Tex reports
were later improved and re-written by the team as it designed
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.equisense.com/en/product.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Motion&lt;/a&gt;. After these few months,
I left the startup for Montréal, where I spent my last semester as a student,
after which I carried out my Master project in Germany. When came the time to
think about what came next, we were still in contact with Camille, Idriss and
Benoit and the conversation shifted to how the project had evolved and the
thousand cool things coming in the next months and could become a &amp;ldquo;real job&amp;rdquo;
this time. After a couple more one-to-one, a few visits in Lille and a hackathon,
I was officially back on the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-back-and-the-baby-is-all-grown-up&#34;&gt;Getting back and the baby is all grown up!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, Equisense launched a successful Kickstarter, reinforcing the
feeling that horse-riders value what the product can bring to their experience.
The company moved from its first office in Compiègne Innovation Center to
the impressive Euratechnologies center in Lille.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/100Days/euratechnologies.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Euratechnologies&#34; /&gt;
[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than this, the team also got bigger to face the challenges of this new
stage. The goal is no longer to hack horses acceleration signals until something
comes out of it, but to build a reliable and intuitive product from the
scientific findings and technological pieces brought together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Really getting on the market requires a deeper bond with horse-riders
and as much feedback as possible. The new team embodies these changes: a
diversity of mindsets, experiences and backgrounds to handle all upcoming
challenges with the same care for clients. The hacker spirit isn&amp;rsquo;t gone in
this new version of the company, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t the major pillar of the culture
anymore. A culture is hard to put into words, but I&amp;rsquo;d say this
second face of our Janus startup is a combination of a &lt;strong&gt;genuine care for
horses wellness and of a passion for horse-riding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/100Days/newteam.png&#34; alt=&#34;The new team&#34; /&gt;
[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that while I was admiring their external successes from my Canadian
home, (the Kickstarter campaign, new partnerships, features of the product
getting out of the ground one by one&amp;hellip;), the most impressive achievement was
being joined by so many diverse profiles while building a working environment
at the image of their horse-riders&amp;rsquo; mindset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The founders already had this care and passion in their DNA, they just
succeeded in transforming it into a full culture and transmitting it into an
obsession within the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/100Days/camille.png&#34; alt=&#34;Camille&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/100Days/benoit.png&#34; alt=&#34;Benoit&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/100Days/idriss.png&#34; alt=&#34;Idriss&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-are-we-in-the-lifetime-from-a-clumsy-foal-to-the-great-stallion&#34;&gt;Where are we in the lifetime? From a clumsy foal to the great stallion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other than the culture, the operations changed from the clumsy foal learning to
stay up on its hoofs to the stallion swiftly jumping and anticipating all
obstacles.
&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/100Days/foal.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;foal&#34; /&gt;
[3]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The seed stage is about using all assets that are or can easily
be at your disposal to run tests and confirm hypotheses. Unlike lots of web
startups, uncertainty does not come only from the market, but also from
the technological bricks: &lt;strong&gt;hardware is today where the web was about ten years
ago&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving forwards meant iterating while building knowledge on both fields of
uncertainty. This meant at the same time assessing if some measured signals
could detect a jump during a training session, and if the customers actually
had an interest in the feature. Working for nothing can be frustrating, but
ignoring something horse-riders want would have been much worse!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/100Days/cso_fontainebleau.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;grown-up champ&#34; /&gt;
[5]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new phase, uncertainty radically changed. In the first stage,
we saw how it was caused by a lack of knowledge on both the
technology and the market. Of course the knowledge the team has on
these topics is still not complete, but
&lt;strong&gt;is enough to make intelligent decisions and move on&lt;/strong&gt;. However, a
new source of uncertainty has replaced the two previous:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organization and processes are obvious when 4 people are working
together on several issues. They become fuzzy and chaotic when several
teams are working at high speed without being able to check on each
other all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key issue is the company&amp;rsquo;s speed to deliver
without letting any randomness in the result. Equisense&amp;rsquo;s customers
are horse-riders willing to improve their experience, care and
efficiency, not hackers accepting a buggy beta with promising
features as long as the product has an API in their favorite language!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equisense changed a lot during my absence to evolve into one of the new
major phenomena in its industry. If I had to describe how it operates
now, I guess I&amp;rsquo;d highlight &lt;strong&gt;the focus, the acceleration and the
deterministic, well-defined outcome of a still random and flexible organization&lt;/strong&gt;.
(hope my data science buddies will tolerate the paradox of the last one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coming months promise to be thrilling with the shipping of the first Motion
sensors, the R&amp;amp;D on improved features, new products and whatever else comes
out of the blue. Even though I&amp;rsquo;m still getting used to working with horses (photos
to come), I&amp;rsquo;m without a doubt excited to have rejoined these crazy riders, so
stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On startup weekends and getting things done</title>
      <link>https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2016-07-11-hackathon/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2016-07-11-hackathon/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s monday morning and I&amp;rsquo;m waking up with a hangover sensation, not from
partying in the streets of Lille as one could think at the beginning of the
week, but from the last intense 48 hours. I took part in the so-called
&amp;ldquo;creathon&amp;rdquo; organized by the
&lt;a href=&#34;https://switchupchallenge.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Switch up challenge&lt;/a&gt; and
&lt;a href=&#34;makesense.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;MakeSense&lt;/a&gt;. The special touch on this event was the social
impact the projects were meant to have. The result could even not be a company
but a non-profit organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to generalize my thoughts as much as possible, but to give a
concrete view of what is going on, I&amp;rsquo;m going to use the example of &lt;strong&gt;Quare&lt;/strong&gt;,
the project we worked on. It is a device quantifying your stress and the quality
of your current working environment thanks to different sensors and
individually adjusted algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;building-a-company-from-the-ground-up-just-let-me-finish-this&#34;&gt;Building a company from the ground up: just let me finish this&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creating the whole concept for a scalable, repeatable and profitable business
based on an issue you want to tackle takes time, focus and creativity. The goal
is not to come up with the most spectacular way to solve the problem and build
your product, but to find the simplest way allowing your business to grow
without limits. &lt;strong&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re not building the Empire State, you&amp;rsquo;re planting an
acorn to grow an oak&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;stop-organizing-everything-mess-is-a-bless&#34;&gt;Stop organizing everything, mess is a bless&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People coming from a business and management background tend to think of
activities in terms of processes, so a structured way in which things are
handled and operated. When designing the concept for a startup, just don&amp;rsquo;t.
The reason is, your team is going through several critical phases where any
constraint in the reasoning would hinder the ability to rephrase the problem
you&amp;rsquo;re focused on, or come up with a radical new way to address it. Just let
the mess happen and collectively feel when it is time to move on to a next step.
If a team member feels like you missed something, simply let them gather their
thoughts and arguments, then try to build on them and see how they change
the concept. However, not everything must be kept if you don&amp;rsquo;t want an
&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.dave-bailey.com/how-to-reconnect-with-your-purpose-as-a-founder-6d18e80ccc9c#.j39hta9i6&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;over-generalized problem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;focus-is-key-to-deliver&#34;&gt;Focus is key to deliver&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part is a bit tricky and you won&amp;rsquo;t find any silver bullet, even less in
this blog post. By focused, understand both being focus as state-of-mind and
keeping your business idea focused on what matters the most to the issue you
address: this is about making real choices which will never please everyone.
Keeping focused and moving fast during the week-end has two
effects. If you play well, &lt;strong&gt;you&amp;rsquo;ll deliver a lot more by the time of the final
pitch&lt;/strong&gt;, and that&amp;rsquo;s an awesome point if you have some of the following
objectives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convince and impress specific people in the room: potential partners, investors, accelerators&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check how comfortable team members are with each other, if you align on your
ambition, your definition and perception of the problem, the way you work and
react under pressure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To relate things to our situation this weekend, we were an initial team of two
engineers working for a middle-stage startup and two designers at ease with both
product and graphical design. A highly motivated business school student joined
the team a bit later in the weekend. We had both a creative and chaotic
enthusiasm to explore the problems related to stress and lack of focus at work
(the issue we decided to tackle) and some ability to focus and to move fast
based on our diverse experiences and skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We addressed the issue of focus at work which is our direct concern while
working in an open-space and dealing with creative work requiring long,
uninterrupted sessions to make the best out of a day.
Even though we spent a great deal of time defining the scope of the
problem and primary targets, we all had this &lt;em&gt;get things done&lt;/em&gt; attitude and
were eager to start realizing something concrete from the beginning. So not
only did we all have a strong link to the problem, we also had a common view on
it, it allowed the team to have a sharp vision and homogeneous of work and focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are also several not-so-good reasons to move fast during a startup
weekend:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Validate technical choices (Should my device communicate through Wifi or
Bluetooth? What information do we need to store from our clients? &lt;strong&gt;Any&lt;/strong&gt;
back-end related question)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Precise quantitative estimates are pointless. Yup, business plans don&amp;rsquo;t have
their place at a startup weekend, if they have a place at all for early stage
of uncertain and radically new businesses. Try to simply get some rough ideas
about the size of the problem, how much would the device cost in production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, to relate this to our situation, we could make a pretty good estimate of
the Bill of Materials based on the sensors we wanted to use and on our
experience with Equisense (what components were needed, the type of
micro-controller, etc&amp;hellip;). We could come out with different shapes for the
device and test it thanks to different people giving feedback which allowed us
to iterate, but that was is. We did not go any further on the economic
projections, nor did we try to build the whole product in two days. Okay maybe
we prototyped the product with an Arduino and the appropriate sensors. That was
clearly unnecessary for the weekend, but still fun to
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SophieDuveau/status/795248595301703681&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;play around&lt;/a&gt; with
hardware and show what anyone can do with a board, two sensors and some cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, one of the team&amp;rsquo;s designers bought an Arduino kit right after the
weekend, a business student decided to go further with one of his personal
projects after seeing how much we had got done after two days.
Even if we don&amp;rsquo;t build the next unicorn, discovering each other&amp;rsquo;s fields and
building a common culture in so little time was in itself a success and a
learning experience.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bringing data science to engineers</title>
      <link>https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2016-05-21-bringing-data-science-engineers/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 21 May 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://matbesancon.github.io/post/2016-05-21-bringing-data-science-engineers/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this article is to present couple challenges waiting the industrial
data scientist or industrial data science teams, the deep reasons I believe are
the root of this inertia, based on my experience (in both data science and
engineering projects) and exchanges with engineers and data scientists. The
last part introduces some suggestions to make the collaboration richer for
both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-isn-t-data-science-already-everywhere-in-engineering&#34;&gt;Why isn&amp;rsquo;t data science already everywhere in engineering?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is surprising that this transition hasn&amp;rsquo;t been so spontaneous. Indeed, one
could think that engineers, belonging to the &amp;ldquo;STEM family&amp;rdquo; (people studying or
working in fields related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics)
would easily embrace the concepts and methods of data science and moreover be
able to identify the potential gains, savings and improvements to carry out
complex projects in a more effective manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;silo-thinking-in-stem&#34;&gt;Silo thinking in STEM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s not the case, most engineers I&amp;rsquo;ve been discussing and working with never
considered these techniques as relevant to their current tasks. So why so
little enthusiasm? A recurrent problem I noticed is the silo thinking of
disciplines created by strong and early specializations, along with natural
distaste and reduction of unknown fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;we-re-not-google-deal-with-it&#34;&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re not Google, deal with it&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when someone will first pitch machine learning to an engineer, I would often
observe reactions of &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not relevant to my field/work/issues&amp;rdquo; because they
don&amp;rsquo;t consider being in a &amp;ldquo;tech&amp;rdquo; industry. This is the same reaction type
observed in companies facing digital disruption (see the excellent article of
Nicolas Colin
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thefamily.co/hot-news/the-five-stages-of-denial&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a personal example, as I was talking to a production manager about the
impact advanced predictive analytics could have on machine reliability and
availability, she advanced the &amp;ldquo;non-tech&amp;rdquo; argument, to which I answered with
examples of traditional manufacturing companies already using these techniques,
including General Electric for turbine monitoring (what they refer to as the
Industrial Internet). His last point was &amp;ldquo;Well sure but&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;re not GE&amp;rdquo;, which
I understood as &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not able to learn from nor to work in that field totally
out of my comfort zone&amp;rdquo;. Although, her discomfort with the methods involved is
easily understandable since it requires key concepts in mathematics, statistics
and algorithm thinking which would often be considered as theory unusable in
their &amp;ldquo;real life&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;my-subject-is-so-complex&#34;&gt;My subject is so complex&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reaction one would observe is linked to an interesting thinking
process: People always tend to reduce the breadth of subjects they don&amp;rsquo;t know,
and to emphasize (not to say oversize) the width and complexity of their own
domain. I recently read a &amp;ldquo;conversation hack&amp;rdquo; to make a conversation pleasant
to someone, in three steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask them what they do for a living&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask them some more details about how they manage things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look impressed, add &amp;ldquo;Wow, that sounds very complex&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don&amp;rsquo;t feel at ease with the introduction of quantitative, rational
methods and analytics for decision-making in their daily work because this
implies that a rather &amp;ldquo;simple&amp;rdquo; model can generate better decisions than them.
It revives this old phobia of losing their job to a machine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;but-still-why-particularly-engineers&#34;&gt;But still&amp;hellip; why particularly engineers?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;rsquo;t address this question yet, and it still sounds counter-intuitive,
given our first statements. From my personal experience studying and working
with both junior and senior engineers, and relatively to business or social
science background, there is a stronger will to &amp;ldquo;master the model&amp;rdquo; and
understand most key aspects of the system they work on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank managers, marketing leaders or finance analysts totally feel comfortable
with the use of data base systems and business intelligence tools, even
statistical analyses or predictive modeling tools they can perfectly leverage,
but not often understand on the technical parts. They would just need to be
able to read, use and trust the results. Engineers, on the other hand don&amp;rsquo;t
feel legitimate when using tools they don&amp;rsquo;t master they feel the need of
understanding and controlling what&amp;rsquo;s going on under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a common vision of the engineers in several cultures, they are the
handy people, able to answer most of your questions, master all techniques from
nuclear power generation to biotechnologies. They are all supposed to be Tony
Stark (or Elon Musk in a more realistic way). So their secret fear is not about
being afraid of getting their job &amp;ldquo;automated&amp;rdquo; but more about a situation where
they cannot handle their system anymore because a part of the decisions taken
is not under their control anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-to-do-about-it&#34;&gt;What to do about it?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-data-science-can-bring-to-their-organization&#34;&gt;What data science can bring to their organization&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proving the utility of data science is the easy part, the process is actually
almost identical to bringing data science to any other industry. The potential
users should be shown what pain points this new field would address in their
business, how similar businesses have already applied machine learning to
their issues, and how the processes should be adapted to these projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-it-actually-works&#34;&gt;How it actually works&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empowering the engineers through explanations of the key concepts might be
seemingly pointless and time-consuming, but helps them accepting the
techniques involved as a part of the &amp;ldquo;internal model&amp;rdquo; secretly hidden in each
engineer&amp;rsquo;s mind and used to think about their system and make decisions upon
it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most engineers are usually used to (at least) basic algorithm structures. So
using it to make them understand the thinking pattern behind machine learning
may help them to understand the mechanisms and feel at ease with reapplying
it. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve covered the fundamentals, a modeling skill should be
developed. Indeed, being able to model a problem as a data science project
will give a pretty straightforward beginning (especially on variable
selections or feature engineering).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basic linear regression (and in general other curve fitting methods) have
already been seen for experimental purposes in most engineering fields. If one
has only time to explain key concepts, I would give the following order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classification principles, example of classification trees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regression techniques (if not already known). Simple and multivariate linear regression, polynomial regression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unsupervised learning, example of k-means clustering.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Overfitting, cross-validation concept and techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensemble learning, example of random forests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With clear but complete explanations of regression, classification and
unsupervised learning, along with a previous knowledge of regression
techniques, most engineers will be able to identify opportunities to get
deeper insights into the phenomena they investigate or to build robust
predictions through machine learning, which is the basic goal to break the
barriers we discussed. The 4th and 5th topics are a bonus allowing them to
understand what techniques data scientists would use, they would not need them
for opportunity identification but to extend their &amp;ldquo;internal model&amp;rdquo;, which can
only be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;key-examples&#34;&gt;Key examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These examples are taken from diverse projects, challenges and data sets
including some personal ones. Each case study is addressed to specific targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process, Energy and Chemical Engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I studied once the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset which can be found on
the UCI dataset repository here. Using machine learning allowed the research
group not to work on the basis of restrictive hypotheses on the thermodynamic
behavior of the gas or steam, nor on the heat exchange and fluid mechanics
phenomena involved (e.g. pressure drop in the pipes due to phase change). The
predictions based on data are a totally new way to combine formal model-based
approaches (including process optimization) and operational realities (the
good old &amp;ldquo;gut feeling&amp;rdquo; experienced staff will tell you about).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Biomedical Engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This also includes all high-level medical professions. Well-known applications
were found in several fields, including pattern recognition from medical
images and data, disease risk estimations from patient background
information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Predictive modeling systems will be a decisive disruption in physicist work,
they replace the human decision-making process, based on few variables and on
a biased and relative experience with the risk-based optimal decision backed
by millions of data points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Industrial, Manufacturing and Quality Engineers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those case studies are inspired by my personal experience and the solutions
offered by several software development companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first one is the application of classification trees to replace rules
defining the quality of a product (first, second class or discarded for
instance). Using proper data mining tools allows the production manager to
define the relative &amp;ldquo;cost&amp;rdquo; of false positives (good products declared as not
salable, which induces all the manufacturing costs without the revenue) and
false negatives (non-conform products sent to be sold, which induces a risk of
complaint, on operation product default, image issues or recall campaigns).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second example is combining time-series analysis and multi-variable
regression techniques to give risk estimations on the process stability and
trends. I observed several software solution providers to whom the transition
from statistics to predictive modeling was a simple and obvious evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bringing machine learning to engineers is a challenge and must be considered
as a promising step for both data science and engineering. Formal modeling
approaches and experimental considerations will eventually be able to be
conciliated. Data science will gain a significant support and become an
accelerator for the development of new techniques.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re an engineer, a data scientist? Have you ever experienced collaborating
with engineers on data science applications? Did you encounter some
difficulties specific to working with engineers? Please get in touch for
further discussion on these topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have discussed what data science could bring to engineers, a
second article may come to explain how to build a predictive model from
scratch in an industrial context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Robert, Benoit and Florian for their feedback on the article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part III: Model development&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To follow the following article without any trouble, I would recommend to
start with the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-does-predictive-modeling-work&#34;&gt;How does predictive modeling work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;keep-the-terminology-in-mind&#34;&gt;Keep the terminology in mind&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is important to understand the principles and
sub-disciplines of machine learning. We are trying to predict a specific
&lt;strong&gt;output&lt;/strong&gt;, our information of interest, which is the category of bank note
we observe (genuine or forged).
This task is therefore labeled as &lt;strong&gt;supervised learning&lt;/strong&gt;, as opposed to
&lt;strong&gt;unsupervised learning&lt;/strong&gt; which consists of finding patterns or groups from
data without a priori identification of those groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supervised learning can further be labeled as &lt;strong&gt;classification&lt;/strong&gt; or
&lt;strong&gt;regression&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on the nature of the outcome, respectively
categorical or numerical. It is essential to know because the two disciplines
don&amp;rsquo;t involve the same models. Some models work in both cases but their expected
behavior and performance would be different. In our case, the outcome is
categorical with two levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-does-classification-work&#34;&gt;How does classification work?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on a subset of the data, we train a
model, so we tune it to minimize its error on these data. To make a parallel
with Object-Oriented Programming, the model is an &lt;strong&gt;instance&lt;/strong&gt; of the
class which defines how it works. The attributes would be its parameters and
it would always have two methods (functions usable only from the object):
* &lt;strong&gt;train&lt;/strong&gt; the model from a set of observations (composed of predictive
    variables and of the outcome)
* &lt;strong&gt;predict&lt;/strong&gt; the outcome given some new observations
Another optional method would be &lt;strong&gt;adapt&lt;/strong&gt; which takes new training data and
adjusts/corrects the parameters. A brute-force way to perform this is to call
the train method on both the old and new data, but for some models a more
efficient technique exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;independent-evaluation&#34;&gt;Independent evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A last significant element: we mentioned using only a subset of the data to
train the model. The reason is that the performance of the model has to be
evaluated, but if we compute the error on the training data, the result will
be biased because the model was precisely trained to minimize the error on this
training set. So the evaluation has to be done on a separated subset of the
data, this is called &lt;strong&gt;cross validation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;our-model-logistic-regression&#34;&gt;Our model: logistic regression&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This model was chosen mostly because
it is visually and intuitively easy to understand and simple to
implement from scratch.
Plus, it covers a central topic in data science, optimization.
The underlying reasoning is the following:
The logit function of the probability of a level of the classes is
linearly dependent on the predictors. This can be written as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;beta0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;beta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;beta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we need the logit function here?
Well technically, a linear regression could be fitted with the class as output
(encoded as 0/1) and the features as predictive variables. However, for some
values of the predictors, the model would yield outputs below 0 or above 1.
The logistic function &lt;strong&gt;equation&lt;/strong&gt; yields an output between 0 and 1 and
is therefore well suited to model a probability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/linear_binary.png&#34; alt=&#34;Linear regression on binary output&#34; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/logistic_binary.png&#34; alt=&#34;Logistic regression on binary output&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can noticed a decision boundary, which is the limit between the
region where the model yields a prediction &amp;ldquo;0&amp;rdquo; and a prediction &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo;.
The output of the model is a probability of the class &amp;ldquo;1&amp;rdquo;, the forged
bank notes, so the decision boundary can be put at p=0.5, which would be
our &amp;ldquo;best guess&amp;rdquo; for the transition between the two regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;required-parameters&#34;&gt;Required parameters&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you noticed in the previous explanation, the model takes a vector of
parameters which correspond to the weights of the different variables.
The intercept \beta_0 places the location of the point at which p=0.5,
it shifts the curve to the right or the left.
The coefficients of the variables correspond to the sharpness of the transition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-process&#34;&gt;Learning process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;parameters-identification-issue&#34;&gt;Parameters identification issue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike linear regression, the learning process for logistic regression is not
a straight-forward computation of the parameters through simple linear algebra
operations. The criterion to optimize is the likelihood, or equivalently, the
log-likelihood of the parameters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- \mathscr{L}(\beta|(X,Z)) = f_{\beta}\left(X=x,Z=z\right) --&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;L&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;beta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;parameters-update&#34;&gt;Parameters update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best parameters in the sense of the log-likelihood are therefore found
where this function reaches its maximum.
For the logistic regression problem,
there is only one critical point, which is also the only maximum of the
log-likelihood. So the overall process is to start from a random set of
parameters and to update it in the direction that increases the
log-likelihood the most. This precise direction is given by the
&lt;strong&gt;gradient&lt;/strong&gt; of the log-likelihood. The updated weights at each iteration
can be written as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- \beta^{(n+1)} = \beta^{(n)} + \gamma^{(n)}\nabla(log(\mathscr{L}(\beta^{(n)}))) --&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;beta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;beta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;gamma&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;gradient_log_likelihood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;beta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several criteria can be used to determine if a given set of parameters is an
acceptable solution. A solution will be considered acceptable when the
difference between two iterations is low enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;optimal-learning-rate&#34;&gt;Optimal learning rate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coefficient gamma is called the &lt;strong&gt;learning rate&lt;/strong&gt;. Higher values lead to
quicker variations of the parameters, but also to stability and convergence
issues. Too small values on the other increase the number of steps required to
reach an acceptable maximum. The best solution is often a varying learning
rate, adapting the rate of variations. The rate at step n is chosen as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;gamma_n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;alpha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;c0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;sqrt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which means that the learning rate is constant for all first steps until the
following condition is reached:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;c0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;c0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this iteration, the learning rate slowly decreases because we assume the
parameters are getting closer to the right value, which we don&amp;rsquo;t want to
overshoot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;decision-boundaries-and-2d-representation&#34;&gt;Decision boundaries and 2D-representation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;decision region&lt;/strong&gt; is the subset of the features space within which the
decision taken by the model is identical. A &lt;strong&gt;decision boundary&lt;/strong&gt; is the
subset of the space where the decision &amp;ldquo;switches&amp;rdquo;. For most algorithms,
the decision taken on the boundary is arbitrary. The possible boundary
shapes are a key characteristic of machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our case, logistic regression models the logit of the probability,
which is strictly monotonous with the probability as linearly
proportional to the predictors. It can be deduced that the decision
boundary will be a straight line separating the two classes.
This can be visualized using two features of the data, &amp;ldquo;vari&amp;rdquo; and
&amp;ldquo;k_resid&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34; data-lang=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;learn_weights&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;data1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;iloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;[:,(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;)])&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;&#34;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning weights on a training subset and getting the error on an other subset
will allow us to estimate the real error rate of our prediction. 100 cross
validations are performed and for each of them, we add the error to a list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following results were obtained:
&lt;img src=&#34;https://matbesancon.github.io/img/posts/BankNotes/figures/GLM_errors.png&#34; alt=&#34;Evolution of the model with different coefficient values&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model produces on average 2.66 mis-classifications for 100 evaluated
banknotes. Note that on each test, 85% of the observations
went into the training set, which is arbitrary. However, too few
training points would yield inaccurate models and higher error rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;improvement-perspectives-and-conclusion&#34;&gt;Improvement perspectives and conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this data set, we managed to build independent and reliable features and
model the probability of belonging to the forged banknotes class thanks to a
logistic regression model. This appeared to be quite successful from the error
estimation on the test set. However, few further progresses could be made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;testing-other-models&#34;&gt;Testing other models&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only implemented the logistic regression from scratch, given that several
models would have increased the length of this article. But some other
algorithms would have been interesting, such as:
* K nearest neighbors
* Support Vector Machine
* Model-based predictions such as naive Bayes or Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
* Classification Tree&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fact of interest: the two first algorithms also build linear decision
boundaries, but based on other criteria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We assumed that misclassifying a true banknote was just as bad as doing so for
a forged one. This is why using a limit at p=0.5 was the optimal choice. But
suppose that taking a forged banknote for a genuine one costs twice more than
the opposite error. Then the limit probability will be set at p = 0.25 to
minimize the overall cost. More generally, a &lt;strong&gt;cost matrix&lt;/strong&gt; can be built
to minimize the sum of the element-wise product of the cost matrix with the
confusion matrix. Here is an interesting

topic on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analysis carried on in this article is still far from the objective of some
data projects, which would be to build a reusable on-line classifier.
In our case, this could be used by bank to instantaneously verify bank notes
received. This raises some new issues like the update of different parameters
and the detection of new patterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Rémi for reading the first awful drafts
and giving me some valuable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
